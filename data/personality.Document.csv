4,i have no excuses least of all for god like all tyrants he is not worthy of the spit you would waste on negotiations the deal we have is infinitely simpleri don't call him to account and he extends me the same courtesy back rip open the diseased heart of a corporation and what spills out on people you're wicked overseer keep government away from my medicare as good a summary of american politics as one is likely to get these days turn your lamp down low holy fuck what's brown and rhymes with snoop dr dre fuck you carl we operate by consensus what if the americans object we don't operate the only fear i have is my failure to adhear his path that ladies and gentlemen was a season opener things that are irritating microsoft excel the best way to describe is as an irl troll record so hard it broke the needle even when it's free it ain't cheap i find it absolutely appalling that anyone could believe that political affiliation would be used to determine who receives medical treatment that's what race and socioeconomic standing are for thanks folks what the fuck steelers in other news the steelers th quarter is the most depressing thing of all time suppose you were an idiot and suppose you were a member of congress but i repeat myself bush was a symptom not a cause the bridge is over fuckin speech is my hammer the liberal media love to be denounced from the right and the right loves to denounce them because that makes them look like courageous defenders of freedom and independence while in fact they are imposing all of the presuppositions of the propaganda system chomsky stop the violence and start the revolution-talib when i give food to the poor they call me a saint when i ask why the poor have no food they call me a communist the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter what i didn't want more characters on heroes and until peoples learn to spot the fanning of mass emotions and the sowing of bitterness suspicion and intolerance as crimes in themselves as perhaps the greatest disservice that can be done to the cause of popular government this sort of thing will continue to occur thank you for still being on the ballot so that stupid people could vote for you how impious is the title of sacred majesty applied to a worm who in the midst of his splendor is crumbling into dust they don't make writers like they used to fuck you dolphin yankees woooo necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves steelers britain's desire to be a big player on the world stage has delivered huge benefits including being dragged into a series of catastrophic wars with america's throbbing tumescence lodged firmly at the back of our throat while at the same time being unable to afford decent roads railways schools and hospitals it's what we call a win-win my fucking computer got a virus incredible i have to quit drinking diet coke much sadness and headaches all aboard the u s s rational basis restoration or why lts is incredible why do you insist that the human genetic code is sacred or taboo it is a chemical process and nothing more for that matter we are chemical processes and nothing more if you deny yourself a useful tool simply because it reminds you uncomfortably of your mortality you have uselessly and pointlessly crippled yourself chairman looking god in the eye spit so hard that it oughta be a crime spit it so hard it oughta be a crime fucking the mind of a child is where the revolution begins kansas city chiefs over pittsburgh steelers disgrace i found my actual wep key classes over home in a week fuck yes we're supposed to call it h n i refuse to back down to pig farmers not today not ever kill them all god will recognize his own face the facts then act on them it's the only mantra i know the only doctrine i have to offer you and it's harder than you'd think because i swear humans seem hardwired to do anything but face the facts don't pray don't wish don't buy into centuries-old dogma and dead rhetoric don't give in to your conditioning or your visions or your fucked-up sense of whatever face the facts then act stability means we run it there are countries that are very stable cuba is stable but that's not called stability avatar best picture wow new orleans now bamboo thinks it's wood and that pisses me off i passed stats motherfucker hey it actually is december and then i got food poisoning show me a completely smooth operation and i'll show you a cover up real boats rock if i see another king i think i shall bite him rule of the great when people you greatly admire appear to be thinking deep thoughts they are probably thinking about lunch we rule by consensus what if the americans object we don't operate libertarianism is just anarchism for rich people progress is made by lazy men looking for easier ways to do things heinlein no one lets charms in the vehicle in the entire united states marine corps r i p i didn't know this but is apparently a hebrew name that means the lord remembers which is basically incredible let's go lions was ejected from the new york

reccommends a healthy weight of gaining lbs wii age on the positive side i have lost of the lbs i gained over the holidays was annoyed with the state of la for sending a notice that my car policy was cancelled on even though that is just my renewal date and they lost the info my insurance company sent oh and it took them months to do something about it my grumpiness was fixed by talking to the rep at progressive she was friendly and talkative like a less annoying version of the girl on the commercials thanks is taking to the vet for her annual check-up i know it's good for her i just always feel a bit bad because she hates it so much dear louisiana office of motor vehicles employees i understand that you probably get stuck dealing with stupid annoying people on a regular basis that doesn't mean you have to be rude to everyone especially not the friendly people like me darn it did an hour long workout and now i'm trying to convince myself to vacuum the house funny every time i have to spell a word over the phone using as in examples i will undoubtedly draw a blank and sound like a complete idiot today i had to spell my boss's last name to an attorney and said yes that's g as in second lapse ummm goonies has recooped from working out and has caught a cleaning bug is making sweet potatoe split pea soup i hope it's good can't believe the amount of mosquitos outside

tonight as a piece of fried chicken turns out it takes a lot of work to burn off a piece of fried chicken was enjoying my morning shower until one of those stupid saints remixes came on the radio i'm all for that kind of thing when i actually go to games but i'm sick of hearing it in regular rotation on the radio a bit mean but damn funny sarchasm the gulf between the author of sarcastic wit and the person who doesn't get it is watching a movie just finished playing wii fit plus and burned an ice cream cone worth of calories now it's ok for me to eat an ice cream right kidding accidentally

playing videogames thinks it might be time for a nap is off to work out i don't want to but it's been days doesn't think the changes to facebook were really needed but honestly i'm more annoyed with

while watching the superbowl later is home from the lockport mardi gras parade and is ready for a nap really wishes that my old doctor's office would learn how to do math i don't appreciate getting

97,me exams epic phail begins chanting in an unknown language with warcraft music playing in the background is gonna get his own laptop soon tomorrow finally after all these years waiting for my revenge on the online world that is o after spending time on watching code geass instead of doing my pw i realised that is was soooo worth it best anime show ever fuck the ending ugh its over d believes that life is like the open sea and truth is the wind in our sails no wonder i'm not moving i suck just experienced water rationing it was fun it's what happens when construction workers screw up and break the water pipe for your block lol no water the whole day today and tomorrow o just had an awesome friday like seriously haha songrocxzxzxzxzzx i have to run run to the moment that set me free i need to know why i hear the sound the sound of my dream nothing comes to my mind realised that he is actually a virgo lol there is no emotion there is peace there is no ignorance there is knowledge there is no passion there is serenity there is no death there is the force thanks to some random person in my class having h n my exams have been postponed for like a entire week so now back to warcraft and imma panic later xd needs to wake up needs to change is now even less likely to study because fortune teller genius told him that he didn't have to loves the rain it makes him feel better for some reason good bye suicidal thoughts hello happy ones moar rain plz d needs to stop consumption of harmful substances but can't d thanks everyone for the birthday wishes appreciate it wants the world to hurry up and end already reflecting upon an entire week of school break good news i cleaned my room bad news that was about the only beneficial thing i did the entire week conclusion i'm sooooo screwed he who has not found something which he would die for has no right to live after hours of online reading and research i have diagnosed myself to have a type of red-green colour deficiency under anomalous trichomy called deuteranomaly life sucks so many words and faces so many different voices where do they lead i love chaos for most are consumed by it blind to its hidden beauty allowing me excludibility to revel at its magnificence i officially have got nothing to do at all like seriously weak hearts faint when troubles rises brave hearts soars steals all the prizes false heart it shrinks small in peace and finds in fear no sucrease it has been confirmed i'm going to poly d now to find a job while i wait the americans have forgotten that they were once terrorists to the british can't believe he overslept today of all days the day of reckoning is at hand xd never thought that he would see the day where he would wish for failure the world is so desperate nowadays that the promise for peace can win a man a nobel prize let's hope that he keeps his word i need to get a shirt that says i don't speak chinese like seriously needz moar trust should only be given to those who truly understand its value let's see we've had typhoons in pacific asia and now heavy flooding in the uk bushfires in australia landslides in turkey volcano eruption in colombia new mutation of h n that's resistant to tamiflu and a whole lot of violent human related killings while here in singapore we complain about water reaching our ankles wtf when you start debating to yourself on the mechanisms of magic you also subconciously debate as to the strength of your hold on reality conclusion fantasy is addictive o o no sense makes nonsense but nonsense makes sense so what then is nonsense in a world without sense o o it's amazing how easily you can find aunties that speak both malay chinese but not english me myself and my computer deja vu had a has a fever got stuck in a jam at orchard road after the jam bus broke down while waiting at a new bus stop two busses drove by without stopping ended up taking four hours to get home god is evil is finally

cat we're all mad here i'm mad you're mad how do you know i'm mad said alice you must be said the cat or you wouldn't have come here women speak because they wish to speak whereas a man speaks only

122,rejects your reality and substitutes his own why i am i'm sorry i'm about to lose you because i'm about to drive into a tunnel in a canyon on an airplane while hanging up the phone house is sad that he missed out on fun to go work for hours it will be hot for the next few days but it looks like we should be getting a denser cloud of percipitation coming over san diego soon which should help cool things down a few degrees but don't hold me to it i'm not an actually meterologist so my interpertation of the satalite imagery might be off a little thinks that sleep is a good idea and who ever invented sleep deserves a cookie a big cookie with chocolate chips fresh from the oven back to my point sleep good first day of school tired scared for when real work comes is amazing of course and the apples to apples champion never relized how tiring it is to be social for exstended periods of time is watching reruns of house on hulu house rocks and when he comes back in two weeks we will see how much worse the crazy people are when house goes at them is excited that he was able to perdict the weather by properly interperting satilite imagery wins take that malmal is going to be full of himself for no real reason for the next couple of hours he also made really good chocolate chip cookies from scratch by hand just got a shot in his ass for his headache that works like how he imagines works like vicodin for house's leg minus the addictive part that is basicly is in a good mood now that he isn't in pain i have my car back does happy dance no one witnessed that is praying for a phone call from the doctors saying the neurologist accepted his referal and will see him soon was at uc yesterday and apologizes if he seemed a little out of it today they gave him another pain shot just spent a half hour ductaping a tin can only to through it out then spent about an hour playing with ductape and made pouch that he will never use feels really cool right now i just want you to know that i'm saying something brilliant i'm just not explaining it very well has the systems for higher brain function and complex thought offline at the moment we apologize for any incovience such as the spelling of this update mr frosty that is the grand finish of a good summer has decided that the laws of physics must not apply to his project one side takes seconds to drain water to the other side the other side takes fron seconds to seconds to empty the same results happen over and over with no explanation just because i know everything doesn't mean i'll be telling you anything true s mind has decided to check out for a while it left a note saying it should be back around am tomorrow s head would explode if his skull wasn't being hammered on by numerious sledge hammers needless to say my headache has decided over the counter painkillers only make it more angry and then i have a witty response house i'm on call to be there its only illegal if you get caught assuming you're stupid enough to get caught in the first place feels the need to say something deep and profound but its very late and he is tired from his workout today with those conditions this is the best he's got does all his status updates in rd person this will likely never change is exhausted stressed and is having an awarding winning bad luck streak in terms of things going his way but for whatever reason was nominated for the homecoming courts is tired and probably sick but likes to stay positive and think its just allergies pretty sure thats spelled wrong too but had an amazing time at a murder mystery party being the main investigator and was close to getting the right answer but didn't have enough information he also intends to finish polishing an essay for english that is way longer than any essay really has the right to be just washed a paper plate so that he could use it for something else it would have been easier to just grab a new one right next to him has probably most likely lost what ever symbolance of a mind he once held she only drinks coffee at midnight when the moment is not right and her timing is quite unusual made the most amazing burritos for dinner and feels sad that he can't finish them and enjoy their great deliciousness anylonger k car break down friday the th me feeling superstious k fail me tired is awsome period got his hair cut at today he just now hopes

chem and then im done with classes for the day i hate wednesdays adversity causes some men to break others to break records back from the gym ms iii class phone sucks i apologize for my last status no real smoke session took place im not sure what it was no dream as if you have forever live as if you only have today going to the gym think what a better world it would be if we all the whole world had cookies and milk about three o'clock every afternoon and then lay down on our blankets for a nap do not go where the path may lead go instead where there is no path and leave a trail parade practice worst time of the day he who strikes first strikes twice it's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper anybody who wants to do stx lanes tonight report to delta barracks by full battle rattle this includes rucksack lbv with compass and water dummy rifle and redlines flashlight have assault pack in rucksack bring kevlar and pc going to the gym hit me up later some people walk in the rain others just get wet anyone who can be replaced by a machine deserves to be may have overworked my abs today feel torn the undertaking of a new action brings new strength going for a long run hit me up later most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second i like running because it's a challenge if you run hard there's the pain and you've got to work your way through the pain you know lately it seems all you hear is don't overdo it and don't push yourself well i think that's a lot of bull shit if you push the human body it will respond the person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it the trouble with being punctual is that nobody's there to appreciate it if you want to be a leader try and act like one there is genius in persistence it conquers all opposers it gives confidence it annihilates obstacles everybody believes in a determined man people know that when he undertakes a thing the battle is half won for his rule is to accomplish whatever he sets out to do if i am not for myself who will be for me if i am not for others what am i and if not now when lunch then going to work out any workout which does not involve a certain amount of danger or responsibility does not improve the body it just wears it out the first rule is to keep an untroubled spirit the second is to look things in the face and know them for what they are you don't drown by falling in water you drown by staying there if i had to select one quality one personal characteristic that i regard as being most highly correlated with success whatever the field i would pick the trait of persistence determination the will to endure to the end to get knocked down seventy times and get up off the floor saying here comes number seventy-one if we wait for the moment when everything absolutely everything is ready we shall never begin getting smoked tonight i'm a great believer in luck and i find the harder i work the more i have of it your toughness is made up of equal parts persistence and experience you don't so much outrun your opponents as outlast and outsmart them and the toughest opponent of all is the one inside your head going on a run monday enough said jealousy is the tribute mediocrity pays to genius i long to accomplish a great and noble task but it is my chief duty to accomplish humble tasks as though they were great and noble the average estimate themselves by what they do the above average by what they are phones dead running the course then to the weight room personally i don't think there's intelligent life on other planets why should other planets be any different from this one since the house is on fire let us warm ourselves going to the qm msc iii class good day goodnight got my battle rattle ready education is a progressive discovery of our own ignorance common sense in an uncommon degree is what the world calls wisdom executive ability is deciding quickly and getting somebody else to do the work those who live by the sword get shot by those who don't why did i want to win because i didn't want to lose despise the fact i have already been up for almost hours nothing in the world can take the place of persistence talent will not nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent genius will not unrewarded genius is almost proverb education will not the world is full of educated derelicts persistence and determination alone are omnipotent the will to win means nothing without the will to prepare excellence is an art won by training and habituation we do not act rightly because we have virtue or excellence but we rather have those because we have acted rightly we are what we repeatedly do excellence then is not an act but a habit i've got a great ambition to die of exhaustion rather than boredom if life gives you lemons make grapejuice then sit back and let people wonder how you did it since light travels faster than sound people appear bright until you hear them speak if you can't convince them confuse them first free weekend the power of accurate observation is frequently called cynicism by those who don't have it far better it is to dare mighty things to win glorious triumphs even though checkered by failure than to rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy nor suffer much because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat here's to you and here's to me and i hope we never disagree but if that should ever be to hell with you here's to me just because everything's different doesn't mean anything's changed as it is the characteristic of great wits to say much in few words so small wits seem to have the gift of speaking much and saying nothing it doesn't work to leap a twenty-foot canyon in two ten-foot jumps common sense is instinct enough of it is genius finished ruck run i've always felt it was not up to anyone else to make me give my best sometimes it is entirely appropriate to kill a fly with a sledge hammer chem test dreams permit each and every one of us to be quietly and safely insane every night of our lives i'm not the greatest i'm the double greatest not only do i knock em out i pick the round if one can stick to the training throughout the many long years then will power is no longer a problem it's raining that doesn't matter i am tired that's besides the point it's simply that i just have to it seems rather incongruous that in a society of supersophisticated communication we often suffer from a shortage of listeners if the path less traveled were the easy path then all would take it thus making greatness simply average people demand freedom of speech to make up for the freedom of thought which they avoid no matter where you go there you are there is no point at which you can say well i'm successful now i might as well take a nap just got back from rugby and the weight room going to eat hit me up later if you're in a fair fight you didn't plan it properly your problem is that you think you have time light thinks it travels faster than anything but it is wrong no matter how fast light travels it finds the darkness has always got there first and is waiting for it it's amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper perseverance is more than endurance it is endurance combined with absolute assurance and certainty that what we are looking for is going to happen before you criticize someone you should walk a mile in their shoes that way when you criticize them you are a mile away from them and you have their shoes it is the characteristic excellence of the strong man that he can bring momentous issues to the fore and make a decision about them the weak are always forced to decide between alternatives they have not chosen themselves i can picture in my mind a world without war a world without hate and i can picture us attacking that world because they'd never expect it motivation is a fire from within if someone else tries to light that fire under you chances are it will burn very briefly surprise me success is not the result of spontaneous combustion you must set yourself on fire if a cluttered desk is the sign of a cluttered mind what is the significance of a clean desk believing requires action between two evils i always pick the one ive never tried before those who are more adapted to the active life can prepare themselves for contemplation in the practice of the active life while those who are more adapted to the contemplative life can take upon themselves the works of the active life so as to become yet more apt for contemplation where am i thinking is more interesting than knowing but less interesting than looking man imposes his own limitations don't set any we run not because we think it is doing us good but because we enjoy it and cannot help ourselves the more restricted our society and work become the more necessary it will be to find some outlet for this craving for freedom no one can say you must not run faster than this or hump higher than that the human spirit is indomitable what i must do is all that concerns me this rule equally arduous in actual and intellectual life may serve for the whole distinction between greatness and meanness it is harder because you will always find those who think they know what is your duty better than you know it restlessness is dicontent and discontent is the first neccesity of progress i cannot have survival as my only goal that would be too boring the slower we move the faster we die one reason we resist making deliberate choices is that choice equals change and most of us feeling the world is unpredictable enough try to minimise the trauma of change in our personal lives there are four ways and only four ways in which we have contact with the world we are evaluated and classified by these four contacts what we do how we look what we say and how we say it success is often achieved by those who don't know that failure is inevitable workouts are like brushing my teeth i don't think about them i just do them the decision has already been made leadership is no more confined to process than writing is to format staying up late reading an analysis of caesars civil war a man who lived by the quote audacity more audacity always audacity his amazing success in life war and politics is yet another hwever old testament that fortune trully does favor the audacious a saying that seems to hold more truth with every experience i have everyone is trying to accomplish something big not realizing that life is made up of little things not gonna sleep good tonight no bees no honey no work no money that was fun i hate the expression what makes him tick it is the american mind looking for simple and singular solution that uses the foolish expression a person not only ticks he also chimes and strikes the hour falls and breaks and has to be put together again and sometimes stops like an electric clock in a thunderstorm going to work out then mapping and setting up stx lanes for tonight hit me up if you want in fight one more round when your arms are so tired that you can hardly lift your hands to come on guard fight one more round when your nose is bleeding and your eyes are black and you are so tired that you wish your opponent would crack you one on the jaw and put you to sleep fight one more round remembering that the man who always fights one more round is never beaten earlier tonight i found a picture of waldo in jail i didn't think much of it until i realized he was probably a wanted fugitive and that's why he is always hiding what is opportunity to the man who can't use it dont you find it funny that after monday m and tuesday t the rest of the week says wtf the truth is that our finest moments are most likely to occur when we are feeling deeply uncomfortable unhappy or unfulfilled for it is only in such moments propelled by our discomfort that we are likely to step out of our ruts and start searching for different ways or truer answers read every day something no one else is reading think everyday something no one else is thinking do every day something no one else would be crazy enough to do someday there is no better time than now the time to live is now the time to dream is now the time to imagine and forget the past is now the time to shine is now the time to bleed sweat and determine yourself for the things you want most is now all things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth all change is not growth as all movement is not forward stx on friday hit me up if you want in the greatest potential for control tends to exist at the point where action takes place dream great achieve greatness our business in life is not to get ahead of others but to get ahead of ourselves to break our own records to outstrip our yesterday by our today when you aim for perfection you discover it's a moving target go to urbandictionary com type in your first name copy and paste this as your status and put the first entry under your name as a comment my alarm clock i had a fight it wanted me to get up i refused things escalated now i'm awake it's broken not sure who won the fight try to learn something about everything and everything about something think see act a failure establishes only this that our determination to succeed was not strong enough don't always think in a straight line we do not rise to the level of our expectations we fall to the level of our training,,2619

rip my shoe well look at it from his perspective when have you had a successful multi-person podcast before aside from wow tcop tgs quite liking the style of this series have you heard of the new nvidia dsr anti-aliasing isn't it absurd to go back to oldschool subsampling versus cheap algos netflix can i see enemy at the gates no but i can show you top gear mythbusters or district netflixrecommendations it's not a lotr game per the title even then the movies were about complex interpersonal things not just meek vs strong and that has been represented though lacking inter-faction things by the nemesis system no thanks i'd rather have tb's face on camera instead of the other end this is largely due to you being afaik honest and open and to a degree personal same goes for tb just keep doing that what's the difference between your cable and this cable aside from the plastic fabric cover hey more spammers sure but if you're going to fix shit you're spending money and if you spend money you're negating that tasty doubledipdough oh no looks like bf had some big launch issues just like bf but bf won't we promise i hope you play games for the gameplay not for the story people like you are destroying gaming s to be fair apple users need cloud-protection the most right now not an ad for apple but a motivation to try dropbox disregard you mean different opinion he's talked about gender issues several times in the past and not everything needs a deep story to be a great game tetris doom pacman etcetera our point is that a preference for p story or genre or aaa or indie a preference won't destroy gaming that's elitist and ungrounded he probably understands issues but disagrees on the degree of which things need fixing it's similar to the debate about affirmative action which in itself is discriminatory and unrepresentative of society upgraded my pc a bit it now streams music and internet at watts forty five my pc is a lightbulb it's fricken awesome hey i just bought a ti sc and was wondering did the rott offer expire or did i overlook something in the box i know you're not a review guy but this is right up your alley a review exclusively about textures this seems an interesting feature will you only review the quality of textures or also explore workflows methods document to find out a persons real name address and as much info about them put it in a file and make it publicly available it's to get as much mud to sling online as well as to scare people irl it's a rather nasty tactic in the sense of you putting together the bundles for sale the term would be curator you curate the collection inventory that's not what he says he says go to cops go to people that can do shit but don't give harassers a podium that's nonsense when someone says they're muslim or feminist you don't associate them with or valerie solanas so why is gamersgate judged by its worst instead of by their best or by their average or on a individual basis how would i be enabling them do asshats need me in order to be asshats no they try to hijack gg so stop validating them to harass a person that was corrupting not saying harassing her is okay just saying it wasn't an attack on women in general there have been fuckups by asshole which should have been addressed but instead media have turned against gamers as a whole none were justified you will not hear me say any of them deserve threats or doxxing heavy criciticism yes harassment no it's perfectly possible to tackle several issues at once aside that i don't harass people so i'm not living in a glass house no offense taken just wanna make clear from that if i talk gamergate i'm still antiharassment because it is an issue ran into the character limit there so i slightly changed phrasing yes you're right it happens but it shouldn't they're saying bullying is like similar not the same in that it's largely a cyclical problem not really gg isn't about removing feminism from games critique it's about transparency of biases relations politics in fact vivian james is quite feminist a decently rounded female character supporting a game designed by women it's a screenshot from the linked article it does matter some feminists some religious people are psycho some gamers are psycho some insert group here are psycho the article in fact clarifies that it's a extremist faction it doesn't indict the gg movement but separates gg harrassers how serious are you about making games there could be a way to work in a few bad apples mechanic regarding gg harassment did a quick google doesn't look like many people support this operation hey did you find an artist for ladra yet i just saw the thread on reported retweeted is it that hard to figure out a link to multiple accounts harassing anita several ggers reported them you i'm calling out violent extremists that supposedly are with me you oppose them but don't call them out sorry is this a competition or something a sport i thought we were talking about people harassing people look at my feed count how many times i've used the hashtag hint once now look at your own feed count i align with the morals of the majority who want transparency i don't align with the harassment cabal valerie solanas erin pizzey killallmen ironic misandry don't worry most feminists aren't like that just a small cabal i won't ask you to give up feminism in return don't tell me i should give up my own values because of a minority okay hey i'm not sure if you want to keep this name doxx and doxxing are bad things living in dark parts of the internet don't engage doesn't mean don't tell the cops don't report to twitter just don't give them direct attention feminists drove erin pizzey out of the country granted she wasn't a man but oh the irony of feminists harassing women guys guys calm down think of a cyanic turquoise i know but don't give up feminism just because a few feminists drove erin pizzey from her job the majority aren't like that i gotta say that entire account feels fake looks like a very obvious double-doublecross no i mean she's a faked anti-gg it's bad satire or to rile up people against anti-gg people hey i've got a weird bug i got an email to confirm a new connection but when i log in it tells me my email isn't recognized gotta say it's quite sexist to tell women they have no power hmm oh because power is not evenly spread throughout a gender so some women have more power than men and can be sexist well i tried that duplicate account link i now indeed have two accounts p but i can only log in to the new one deleting it derp figured it out i hailed mary typed my gmail address logged in to primary account received the invitation via hotmail so i figure they used my old contact info thanks for helping me narrow this down anyway well this is an appropriate glitch a video about being in in a quantum state being in a quantum state this this is a pretty decent high-level abstraction of everything well done diagrammer though why do some of the arrows float they refuse to give oxygen to a disturbing minority who harass bully or intimidate not gamergate as a whole why should i donate to people i disagree with how would it help against harassment i'll just report harassment to twitter ok who claims ignorance gg people are reporting on distantiating from the harassers analogy if you support islam after this is a job for gaems jurnelizm i feel this lacks a keyboard and mouse he used it twice in the past week and once in this url that he cannot change except for the johnbain at the end not quite the top two are the same but the bottomright one is f c instead of c sorry it looked like the f had no terminal but after matching x-placements it seems an f indeed but next time maybe use unscaled shots or at least the same scaling ratio for both snippets not anymore they don't surprisingly their about page is currently missing the partners list it's plausible not checkable mercedes used to advertise but gawker hid the ad-partners list recently i'm not entirely sure we should companies pressuring media is a risk they could enforce better reviews etc jeff gerstmann true which is why i'm on the fence secondary issue this hits more than just sam then again several coworkers act similar frankly i'd rather see a change in attitude open conversation instead of only covering the harassment than see people fired because these tweets are in the grand scheme of thing less important than the radio silence regarding transparency you asked how gawker relates to game journalism it owns a game journalism site i answered exactly what you asked gawker is relevant because it owns kotaku and thus bears responsibility for it deadspin doesn't own kotaku and the sad part is deadspin actually did cover gg ethics and in a more balanced way you mean jeff gerstmann no the corrupt ones would be the people that fired him for giving too low scores not if it's relevant a review may be personal as long as it's transparent dropping it now isn't good the media only responded to the bad side harassment they need to talk about transparency coi sure but we can choose who we read we learn how a site writer thinks and use that as a reference point e g totalbiscuit often says he doesn't like platformers so when he likes one that's notable same goes for other aspects,,1834

199,i am so hungry right now itunes on the iphone is so confusing to me i hope it's easier to master on the computer one day i decided i would have a day to myself instead of going out with friends i haven't seen those friends since that day it's been years now god my brother in law is annoying my day consists of school twitter instagram tumblr food music and sleep and i wonder why i don't have a life living on an island with very small minded people who tend to piss me off doesn't help monday i will start running and training for next year i think not sure if i should get up at and go for a walk run or wait until after school tomorrow help newfittie i literally hate my body that's why i have decided to change it i have dogs small medium large all black with a little white bit on their chest it's like i have the three evolutions of a pokemon sometimes i think yeah i'm gonna ace today and then fuck you fuck him fuck her and fuck the world i'm going back to bed i don't bother watching the news it just depresses me it's always the cat got run over never the cat was saved from falling out of a tree by a nice man walking home from work i'm kaput so i'm off to bed night night x it's a shame i can't watch a possession movie without scaring myself so bad i almost have a panic attack just got a flat on way home glad someone actually knows what they are doing this changing of the hour has really fucked up my body clock i will be waking up at tomorrow great another day to be awkward at school sometimes i wonder why i want to be a hairdresser if every time i talk to someone i have a panic attack got choc philly all over my iphone can't wait for the day i can walk into the tattoo shop down in the city and tell them exactly what i want i will most probably fail this exam i feel like i am going to fail this year my first exam and i only passed by point just given my mum a pedicure now it's her turn to give me one peas in pesto for dinner i really can't be asked today just getting dressed is an effort looks like i'm going to get caught in a rain storm and i haven't got an umbrella i wish i didn't have panic attacks whenever i even think of going out once of my dogs is scared of storms so now she is following me about the house so pissed off right now i wish i was pretty or at least cute studying for exams on thursday and next wee why did i want to continue to college and not get a job i think i'm getting a cold i really want to clean my room but i really can't be bothered i really do hate myself am i alive or just breathing i hate my body and i hate the way i think about myself ive only been up minutes and i cant stop sneezing my stomach keeps making weird noises and this is so embarassing in public at least my makeup has decided to make me look good instead of a year old who's found her mothers lipstick why am i always ill for halloween do ghosts come and make me ill on purpose cause if they do they could stop right about now before the snotty gates are opened i really can't be bothered with life today starting the night with shutter island well shutter island confused the hell outta me last night now watching summer's blood still can't decide if it's good or not for the moment it looks like it's weird sometimes i don't even know who i am another fun filled day so much sarcasm even sheldon cooper notices it watching brave with my niece and mother in law i love my boyf he does so much for me even when i don't deserve anything two days running with waffles for breakfast sometimes i wish i was someone else everyone i know has got going to have their cars bought for them i only know one person who is buying their own car and me i just walk i want for there to be a really big storm today or tomorrow i just downloaded wanelo and i'm already addicted i love it follow me on wanelo i won a win the lottery and buy myself a entire wardrobe of new clothes i think i have changed a lot in the last week i have realized a lot of things and actually thought about some stuff i missed my parka so much this summer i hate my body so much i weighed myself and went through most of my clothes to find i am a small whale and hardly any of my clothes fit me anymore i even hated myself when i was like i shouldn't be left on my own for very long i start to think about things that i really shouldn't think about for my own mental health what my biggest decision today has been to take a bath or not god i'm boring i have become one of those people who doesn't mind anything doesn't have any actual interest in life and doesn't have a favorite anything i don't want to be like that this bath shall be dedicated rose aching the net for things i might like i need interests grease lightning go grease lightning why dont i live in america i don't want longer hair i need longer hair i didn't know ordering extensions would be so hard got my eyebrows done today yay now dyeing my eyelashes i think i might start doing yoga put the old yoga stuff to use at least there is a girl in my class that has tattooed her brows on but in the color she dyes her hair and not her natural color c so she has red eyebrows and now wants to change her hair color to blonde i am so bored of everyone in my class already and we have only been at school for two months this is going to be a long year i have put on so much weight so quickly the scars on my leg has deformed my leg wow i bet that was a lovely image i want a double bed i can't wait to move in with my boyf do the weekly shopping cook him meals watch films together i'm going on if someone compliments me and i ignore it it's because i think they've been paid to say it or are going to be mean like you have lovely eyes and then once i have said thanks they'll say shame your so ugly or something i'd love yo be blonde but i don't trust myself not to mess it up and the hair salon would be way to expensive to get roots done every month i just realized that in years time most of us will have kids and tweet about them a lot i love going clothes shopping but i easily get stressed out if there are more than two people in the shop with me i should make a habit of checkin my back in the mirror at least once before leaving the house yesterday i had a giant white feather on my back and no one told me until people started making chicken noises at me my order has shipped yaaay my tl comes alive just as i am getting ready for bed i am so annoyed my hairdresser cut my fringe wonky like i paid you to cut a straight line and you really couldn't do that once my extensions arrive i will be on my way to the shop to buy dye d i miss dying my hair funny colors but my hair will fall out if i bleach it again,,1366

218,which are complex but those are additions to what starts from a physical determined region in the brain that is called the hypothalamus one cannot discuss a shift of balance if one hasn't defined the scope i e the extremes to reply on your opening tweet in general the urge to self-protect is stronger due to a larger short-term effect of survival it is not a x versus y case it is a x case with an additional layer of y this shift of balance was about the fight versus harmony balance you started with people fight hurt as part of self focus survival dominance whatever you want to call it and if you want a discussion you need to provide a better model than i just gave you as an explanation otherwise it is not a discussion session but a mere teaching information session well then lets conclude you and i have different perceptions of discussions mine ends here for sake of being friends typical thing the scottish and the dutch have in common i am the exception to the rule though very generous i actually need to learn the lesson you provided d so you dress up undress and dress up again to go to the party p i second that i think i owe you all some picturs of my favourite forest they'll have plenty of content to lol about d s are you forgetting you are an introvert they can't go to two parties and be thrilled about it s p my world of expectations is slowly falling apart oh well enjoy introverts talkative depends on the subject ordinary shit istj's read wait wut parties all night mental breakdown drops on knees praying for reassuring patterns read how we operate any type can be very talkative it all depends on the subject at hand only valid if all risks to life are comets never apologise for the truth words can not harm you only if you chose to turn to the dark side do not r i p here lay the remains of what once was a sensible human being dearly beloved by his fellow infj's prince we miss you haven't found true love yet don't worry reality always is sounds like a trailer to the next episode in the hannibal lector series please don't mistake realism with pessimism do you have a religious belief that your true love will be a virgin that is a pessimistic perception an optimistic version would be to think your future love is gaining experience so who is the pessimist now p ignoring reality in a consistent pattern is a sure way to develop mental illnesses just saying btw in what subculture do you live where people screw their cousins if she was a transgender it could have been his cousin the ne part of being enfp deals with creativity in thinking so isis is islamic after all thanks for the information and how did you meet your husband he shouted something sexually aggressive at me from his car and we just went from there really btw chimp you're an introvert right makes all perfect sense now p just when i think i'm alien free o o when is the alien due to emerge from your body isis uses quran to recruit amongst moderate muslims worldwide not amongst budhist christians jews and the concept of islamic state also comes from the quran and you do realize isis executed verse from the quran recently you do realize places of the netherlands are meter below sea level for ages lowest being meters so risk of flooding is not merely an average of area's below sea level also the experience and existence of countermeasures thanks i just tossed my breakfast and please inform me when and where did isis say they are against islamic teachings from the quran that is correct we have both our tech is even acknowledged world-wide can you fly that thing not yet they use the literal version of the quran with the quran in hand they recruit moderate muslims you would expect moderate muslims to be able to distinguish between right and wrong quran especially if moderate muslims know about true islam there is nothing to debate it is clear to all quran is abused by isis to recruit moderate muslims you really want to debate isis recruits muslims by abusing the quran you're delusional show me isis recruited christians budhists jews or atheists you can't they recruit muslims no you are the real problem in denying isis does recruit muslims debate my first statement bring me proof that i am wrong yes i can for isis did the same do you read the news i am referring to isis recruitment amongst muslims can you even read again i will paste a link to my first claim read this time this is something different scotsman dont recruit isis do recruit amongst muslims simple don't waste your time warren tariq continuously shows to have trouble reading and interpreting correctly s but hey that is what muslims do all day interpret the quran islam the way they see fit ignoring simple facts take a guess p the question can you even read may seem rude but is logically correct after tariq ignoring four times my first tweet focus on the part where i state isis does not recruit amongst budhists jews christians atheists and that isis abuses the quran to recruit amongst muslims whatever blend they are please paste a link to the tweet where you said this the first time i missed it so when recruitment comes from qur'an it is islamic fair enough my sincerest apologies for using can you read as ad hominem attack it took you tweets to agree and here you go denying again as in your first reply as i stated before isis abuses the qur'an to recruit amongst muslims for the quran is their only connection only with quran in their hand is isis able to connect with muslims for recruitment quran is only commonality you continue to miss the point it is not about the content of the quran but about the quran used by isis i blame the quran for being so easy to be misused by isis in recruitment practices the holy book of jainism cannot be used to recruit people to do violent things only quran can be used by isis for violent recruitment and yet isis is using the qur'an in their recruitment process why keep arguing against factual events even though quran doesn't teach that isis is still able to use the quran to connect to muslims worldwide people blatantly denying factual events is the cause of most problems ok you're of the hook for now are they i thought turkey opened their airport for usa choppers to help protect kobane do vitamins also work against islam i already gave you the walhalla about experiments why do you even think i chose the brainiac name google selfish gene and find the book by evolutionary biologist richard dawkins and i already gave you this specific tweet earlier to be real if your unable to research tweets from the past hrs how will you be able to catch up on all readings then ignore richard dawking for all i care focus on neuroscience lesions hypothalamus and their effects archetypes were defined in the collected works of carl jung archetypes are independently found amongst all cultures around the world and are typical patterns in human behavior resulting in complexes archetypes are the inborn part of complexes google jung archetypes and you'll find a wealth of info on the subject all info can be found here sign up find gamers here in what way did he ignore those two did you also click the urls for info weird i see many jungian models explaining racism by means of the archetypal shadow for example but there is a perfect logical reason for this on a scientific level psychology of racism sexism and other subjects related to discrimination and oppression have been researched plentyfull you see the less prevailing in mainstream psychology due,,1360

you happy waaaah i can't stop crying glee i'm so weird and awkward lol i really want some pizza right now why can't it keep raining no one cares unless you're pretty or dying the worst thing about cooking is cutting raw meat i wonder if my parents would kick my ass if i get my tattoo done while they're gone it's friday night time to turn up loads netflix hahha literally my life will only date a boy if he takes me to lego land describeyourcrushin words let's see asshole dumbass idiot wait isn't idiot dumbass the same thing sorry i'm dumb did you really forget to turn on the oven lol that was meant to say naaaah sugar mata is probably my favorite character of all time i wanna write i miss you on a rock and throw it at your face so you know how much it hurts to miss you i cannot stress to you all how much i want to go swimming in a pool full of pudding damn girls go through a lot do you want to build a snow man or nahhhhh me my cousins are probably the rudest people ever we got tickets at chuck e cheese made the lady give us as much smarties as we could get with the tickets then we played more got more tickets went back did the same thing over again like times you could tell she was pissed cause she said are y'all joking us umm no her i'm not stupid and then when i went to help my little cousin with her tickets her oh my god really again are you serious i think i'm the only one who is actually okay with going to schoool tomorrow i would rather be doing something with my life then sit at home really don't understand why girls get periods a text saying congrats you aren't pregnant should be enough mean girls finally on netflix my life is complete one time she punched me in the face it was awesome reginageorge you used to be just another stranger but now your face is the only one i'd recognize in a crowded room wow you're gonna be a bitch to me out of all people me after everything i've done for you fuck you too then pero it's a boy i'm tired i'm cold and i feel like shit not ready for school tomorrow at the end of the day it's always you so there goes barcelona manchester united someone should dye my hair for me just woke up time to eat then go back to sleep for the rest of the day can i stay in bed all day sleep all day netflix all night thank you rita ora for ripping off zac effron's shirt ritaoraforpresident i wish i had an australian accent sos in chicago already i can't fucking handle this people in your life will come and go and you can either run from it or learn from it i'm seriously in love with avoiding the real world by watching netflix all day isn't a choice it's a life style the blackhawks need to get their shit together people are like oreos the good stuff is on the inside x that just made my heart stop why so i guess you don't like eleanor since my little brother doesn't have school today i should stay home too why am i so obsessed with toews im that girl that gets mad at you doesn't want to talk to you but gets extra mad when you don't even try to talk to me once it's tomorrow that's basically friday anyway so it's fine thank you bickell i hate the whole next goal wins shit and the blackhawks win thank you patrick kane that awkward moment when someone asks you what's wrong and they're the problem not everyone will like you but that's part of life the best place to get a six pack is at the liquor store lol why do i always laugh at this first tattoo tomorrow hopefully don't fuck with me when i'm hungry i'll be such a bitch lol every time i use the wrong version of there i die a little inside flaws make you human guys don't try to be perfect be you be who you are and never change you're amazing the way you are you are honestly the weirdest child ever lol my problem is that i can't stay mad i always end up forgiving people even if they don't deserve it all i want is the taste that your lips allow i regret getting the update for snapchat where can i pay someone to run their fingers along my back until i fall asleep the fact that my dad went out this late just to go get me food cause i was hungry that's some bullshit those gunshots honestly scared the shit out of me the only reason why i hate living in summit i'm honestly done with school already summer needs to hurry the fuck up crazy how people can be so easily fooled by others these days need to hurry the fuck up mothers day is stressful what do you get someone who has given you everything who i didn't think i would spend my sunday night in the hospital can't believe i'm missing the game me pretty pretty please i'm single by choice it's just not my choice i honestly didn't think i would cry today even though i wanted high school to be over i'm gonna miss it so much why do i have to be up this early prom is in about hours yet i'm still laying down these are the reasons why i don't like kendall jenner lorde is honestly perfect i just wanted my damn fireworks summit cops are assholes i get the guy is saying shit to you but he's

224,i really want a job but no one will take on someone part time and i cant leave school i never realized how annoying year olds are until i met my boyfriends niece i think tomorrow will be one of those take million phitos and only be happy with and edit the crap out of them days that last retweet actually worries me now i did a thing and started a blog i love having a tidy room i just don't like putting things away or folding clothes another storm this morning of the time i spend at my boyfriends house i feel like he thinks i am an idiot and that his family hate me i'm always the bad guy so now i am sat alone in his bedroom while they all have lunch downstairs back to square one your hair grows cm a month more or less so cutting it every month doesn't really help for leaving it long in that case my advice would be cut off all the damage and then start trimming cm off every months back to school tomorrow and i have't done my hairstyles project for class found the perfect bikini for this summer if this headache doesn't stop i am going to start crying i really don't want to move but i need to get stuff ready for school tomorrow and then i would have to get up anyway for bed i have finally understood that yeah maybe i should weigh less to be healthy but ya know what i am not hugely fat and disgusting i am actually the average size it's not like i am as wide as i am tall can you be allergic to like all food i go through stages of loving my makeup and wanting to use it all all of the time and then hating the idea of spending mins on it i pulled out of my scalp what i thought was one thick hair with a split end turns out it was like hairs together perfectly healthy get featurepoints on ios or android to earn points you can exchange for great prizes for trying free apps use this code exxhwt for point hi guys another girl on here was nice enough to post about this app and i thought i would share it a list of people i actually like being around all this about

237,all of this should be discussed with the media as a secondary point most important now are transparency ethics and coi retweeted reported the ethics point about bayonetta isn't quiiite true did you only read the reddit op op is for the operation majority of comments and both other links shoot him down one guy yes a few supporters versus a lot of opponents polygon says gamergate wants us to do this it's very misleading damn i gotta process this for a bit you have the right to complain but this is advocating that publishers have power over scores that's shilling it's corrupt it is not reasonable publishers influencing game scores by withdrawing ad money is hugely damaging to journalism dude you have made huge mistake promoting operation bayonetta changing review scores because of publisher pressure is corrupt good thing she was already kicked from twitter about a week ago then huh hate speech you consider i think this game is sexist to be hate speech eh i don't think the bayonetta review is hate speech not really it says that the sexualization is gratuitous and meaningless it doesn't say you're horrible for liking that i'm a bigot because i disagree seriously grab a dictionary and look up bigot hate speech corruption and coercion saying i think this uses needless amounts of sexualization is not hate speech this isn't gender sex shaming it's saying the reviewer doesn't like something it doesn't judge you for liking tits and ass good to hear your voice again and know you're playing games again makes me happy that you're getting on your feet or it's because pc gamers persona you can't develop games on an xbox or a phone pc games have mods pg gamers are engaged how about you interview some every-day-muslims instead of isil i e people that support gamersgate but aren't harrassholes this awesome project is still around get smarter and feed people school meals via nowhere on my site does it say we are journalists oh gamergate hey can we have a calm rational discussion without calling names why exactly do you feel the bayonetta review is hate speech tags alone don't mean much anyway gamergate feminism isis uspresident shoes see look at the whole person not a tag i'll send comforting words but i won't finance their projects because i simply don't agree with them that makes sense right reported for spam i'm sorry for you i'm sorry that someone damaged you so much that you now want to see others hurt in the same way sober is good relaxation is good being alive is good even if it might not always feel that way don't be an asshole okay can you show me i don't like people harassing anyone i assume you've already reported twitter the bravest thing a muslim can do right this moment is to leave the religion because isis yeah that rethoric doesn't fly decrying an entire group for the actions of a minority isn't the correct way to go weed out the harassers not the whole is the harasser banned removed yet so link me there so i can report you're making it kind of hard for me to condemn harassment this way or rather to act i'd hardly consider that a bannable offense though but yeah i'll see if i can calm some people down dude just stop it it's not worth the effort because this guy will get offended by pretty much anything just ignore him i assume by now you doun they consider pretty much vulgarity a slur and it's no use bothering if not well now you have you know what i give up i tried to be supremely soft but even that apparently won't do i hereby condemn harassment please do not contact me anymore i hereby condemn all harassments i feel we should report them particularly ones about death here are some egregious ones that hurt me a lot insulting me as a gamer can we please report this account for harassment insults and triggering that does not give him the right to harass all those who didn't i haven't yet i am now hurt you are the one that started messaging them again despite them clearly not wanting that i feel like i now also have to report you for spam unless you stop contacting us from now on will not ask again stop contacting us in return i will not contact you remove me from your messages and do not contact or mention me again also don't retweet me i do not want any more interaction with you whatsoever this is not a question well that's not true comments poef weg comments was it this thread a case study in youtube promotion and paid promotion disclamer vandaar edit regarding deletion the official reason the admin gave me was that it was a fuckup and they reapproved it now gamergate makes such a big deal she's been on nyt msnbc npr yet gamergate is the one inserting her into the discussion instead of the media corps you mean directly having a financial tie with the people you report on british gamer who disagrees with feminist critiques of gaming culture argues on her blog aangehaald als expert cathy young writes a weekly column een nieuwsartikel enjoy jennyohenry cosmicglider lewd me techyfolks twilightpheonix grass is one of the most essential foilages it worked wonders in things like trackmania and charles manson was a vegan go figure volkert van der graaf as well also hitler clearly these vegans are a bad group dutch newsshow paints gg as a hate group uses conflicting footage take note be calm please give them a day to respond cuz office hours then tomorrow contact them and calmly explain why you disagree gamergate equality fairness reported retweeted the media reject discourse and keep painting all of gamergate as a hategroup they tell us to drop the hashtag because it is tainted gg are actively fighting that minority because they feel the gamergate hashtag is worth cleaning if the media so desperately want us to switch hashtags let them create a clean one with traction and move the discussion notice how the only one of those screenshots with the hashtag attached to it very quickly got a bunch of reports the absurd thing is they're not supporting gamergate they're just against gawker the enemy of my enemy doesn't always apply no revolt was based on anger at a dev sleeping with a journalist a pr person a boss and an award judge read them i agree with you on many points however i think that a distinction between those who want ethics and those who hide behind ethics is definitely one that should be made from the start there was this division and yes the hashtag is tainted to a degree but like muslims isil christians kkk i feel it's unwarranted to ask people to drop the gg hashtag if anything journalists should start their own fresh tag with a decent amount of traction if they want people to switch don't do this contacting advertisers over bullying is a bit of a grey area but you decide however this is unethical because there are conflicting interests you're promoting a publisher to financially pressure a higher score that is an arguable point but even if we would agree the methods you use are unethical the end doesn't justify these means personally scores as a precise number are bullshit because reviews are very personal and should serve as an anchoring point i know i disagreed then as well i disagree a reviewer may have biases as long as they're transparent and obvious and we may criticize them for that but we may not try to force their opinions away no it's an attempt at reasoning with you i'm not preventing you from doing this i'm saying that what you're doing is promoting developers to force a re-review on one of their games which would be coercion and would ruin journalistic isolation everthing is seen through a personal lens though what makes a story good what is good gameplay fast slow an impartial-as-possible review would be nothing more than listing mechanics bugs and reiterating box quotes do you think totalbiscuit is a good revie cough first-impressioner because he acts more along sjp ethics than many game journalist blogs yet his opinions are strongly personal example the intro makes it very clear he doesn't generally like puzzlers or platformers which is a bias but because he's frank about it i can take those biases in to account if i myself do or don't like them it's here and i'm still awake give me a few minutes our core disagreement is about the inclusion of personal opinion and biases correct i have to go to work in shush that's insulting and adds nothing to the discussion i've reported several doxxers when i could they are now banned is that a specific enough denouncement i generally don t demounce an perob completery rather specific actions example operatio bayonetta i believe we should focus on bad behavior not people everybody makes mistakes some are stupid some are vile i denounce those that are actively inflicting harm i try to esucate those who are dumb or ununformed those two accounts i mentioned had only negatives they're gone now gotta work again now sorry for all spelling errors on a phone and correcting takes too long p well he's not wrong sexism is treating someone a particular way because of gender it doesn't necessarily have to be hate for example holding open doors for women but not men it's sexist it's stupid but i'd hardly call it hateful behavior,,1624

246,that page is missing this comic where can i apply for an exception to the restriction to id's for redistribution of twitter data does dh have proceedings publications why the distinction poster short long paper if only abstracts no i meant dh not dhbenelux you were at dh right i believe so not sure about specifics eg as co-author especially not if you are first author only once they probably want a registration for each accepted submission and will not normally accept multiple submissions from the same author or group of authors so maybe they'll accept if the submissions are superawesome a big article about wee things where can we buy this yes there is e g increased rate of repetition who says the same people exist in those universes is it higher or lower or just different ouch also amazing how actually having money affects your spending i find p what makes a song catchy find out next monday h first dh lecture as a means of smoothing then off to ghent to speak at autumn meeting

workshop excl accommodation breakfast not even lunch included twitter app keeps showing notifications while there are none inside damn you ios and that's not the only ios issue i'm experiencing could be either first problem with installation now also location services and music console no loc servs are on and permissions correct but when sharing photos from ios to fb it doesn't recognise this so no clinton dynasty what about that third bush maybe running for president congrats scholar for being an academic's best friend the past years and many more to come so apparantly some private messages

riddles for you to guess codecampcc but apparently only if you pay anyway i found another solution by logging in and crawling dowloading the pages you're right but the bot doesn't have its evaluation module yet so it can't respond yet p thanks for the suggestion mike it's appreciated we are working on a way to evaluate some of the hints thanks for playing along you were right team wildcard still very hopeful codecampcc going to the hotel after some late night twitter bot coding codecampcc will work further in lobby though p weird because that option is completely unfunctional in my version

less problem tired damn tired my weekend is being delayed more and more when you spend most of the day in office you will know that you are upto something twitter changes again not bad though love is a lost art so many days with all different names does the love day exist i think that is missing in the merchandising of products late enough for a sleep but so many things to do still i am enjoying my late nights at office students now may be i should be prepared with some proper syllabus now measuring the depth of life feeling the need for a long holiday but have to listen to him who never stops doing his job i think it is high time to forget and forgive if you don't trust your lover you are not confident of yourself the more you want to hold onto something the more you risk loosing it love is no exception loosing your cool for nothing is not a good thing th student here with unique problem may be it is easier said than solved miracles doesn't happen nowadays we have to make them happen for the moment i need a break from my life my weakness makes me stronger that does not mean it goes away meeting old friends always brings back memories good ones ofcourse body wins against

this just this sunday morning i wud have lughed at him but am i bitten by the bug again it why do people think love as reason to live rather than just another part of life can love happen second time dilemma i never knew the meaning better this the cartoon that angered cm i just like the special dose of vitamin only if it is as smooth as today's every morning i lie to me when i get up and it stays with me throughout the day the score after a long time a day that may be remembered for years for good or bad madly or badly it is always deadly sarat is here another one feeling lonely after a long

331,does heroes of the storm count e following some game people one bajillion tweets per second bringing new meaning to the term board member because wool things are more volumetric and flat spiky things like leaves teeth and road look better as felt cause you're uninformed sudan uganda cambodia genocides yang xinhai ramadan mansour luis garavito mass murderers doesn't matter much plenty of them support it current alpha males didn't start patriarchy either it's not about the money it's about promising video a month and only delivering vids in years no pc advisor inkjet printers do not fall under the category of color laser printers and no anything that has a sticker saying xerox is not an hp officejet nor is the a laser printer i'm really saddened that you have macro photos of tablet screens test photos on phones but no sample scans for printers he has a tiny point but misses the parts where reviews drive purchases and where letsplays are transformative in nature i really quite like it that red bull will just up and fund stuff like danny macaskill's imaginate via availability of old obscure quirky bad games is not a bad thing the prominence and promotion of those games is it sucks when your phone suddenly won't read a simcard any more it sucks even more when your pc breaks while looking for a solution hurray for dutch sportsball huh i was on and noticed all the d models work just fine on my nexus thumbs up for crossplatform functionality the current bundle is worth it just for s fantastic pineapple smash crew today fear soaked fabric as over victims suffered a gruesome fate my wardrobe shrunk from cm to only cm among the casualties are tops tees longsleeves dress shirts pants shorts and a suit just saw fireworks in the netherlands wondering if it's for fifaworldcup bravscol or some u s expats celebrating independenceday man what a waste of a tweet talking about responses you don't like you could have spent it on making a wtf is video but today is not that day because its spelled g tze and oe is the internationally accepted spelling when you don't have access to diacritics is this in response to the recent gamasutra article ftc quote bought a new pc with windows hoping it wouldn't be so bad now with the updates after a day i'm on the verge of a mental breakdown seriously who had the idea to replace the standard calculator by a full screen app i don't need x to multiply some numbers instead you want these chocolate marzipan sugarsprinkles don't know the english name yeah i've been looking into similar things like the stuff from not sure what i end up choosing yet also w apparently has regular calc but also an appified version as default for added confusion and frustration sigh definitely gonna give it a try seems to be the most feature rich one and i love the price of free right now i don't really know there's no way to disable the metro bit outside of rd party cont pix or it didn't happen or linx maybe they're taking the adage all publicity is good publicity a tad too literal heh i like how they call forbes unprofessional it's only a century old business magazine after all well dota ti championship final was a bit of a letdown very one-sided almost like the brazil fifa matches earlier this month how come nl eu prices for businesses are so skewed i almost understand but there's no way should statistics colors games graphs numbers info money jerbs exclamation marks gamedev ooh freddie mercury i loved his music in neverending story as well but why is that spiderman quote in there your bundle currently costs i thought that was funny remember when you mentioned ru-ua-eu war it's already happening on kickstarter according to areal this is a good looking kickstarter love the vid and the header gifs oh and the game itself looks interesting too i wouldn't hurt the proverbial fly but those damn mosquitos just killed at least two dozen of the bitey fuckers with you being you i'm not sure if that's asap or never how come art software always has such a shitty gui i'd assume that designers would understand appreciate usability will this work with the regular pc forum accounts or do we have to make new ones would be handy to have that integrated gotta be honest here these sprites feel kind of blurry and lacking detail a downside of d or maybe a render filter issue can hardly wait for pc version x what i've gathered there are a bunch of small visual tweaks and a lot of under-the-hood work yeah i know they're x i scaled the image down to first to check my gut does ingame have normals or something i just finished my last game for the day this should be a nice way to unwind it really depends on the quality of the stuff much like chocolate often i find they add too much powder too i uh what dafuq don't worry you will be surgeried by only the most pro of fessionals how are the podcasts rubbish only thing edited for the yt version of that are the commercials right i get the removal of streamed regular music i do but background music from games and beyond that do you think that it should apply to games in general textures models etc too you generally say that streaming is a transformative art technically this is a mobile game and i'm not sure i would call this playing yup salticidae are definitely the bestest coolest and most awesomest spiders no you'd be wasting far too much time debugging variables when such a simple command is all you need ooh sanchez i strongly approve of this i'm in that camp everyone has a smartphone now which makes it a true personal computer the biggest problem with round robin is a lack of focus sports thrive on spectators semi finals get more views says it right there the jester race a song by in flames given that you regularly do long takes though this one felt slighly off j k well done zooc lamb allergy is a pretty lame allergy i think you're mixing up gone home and dear esther not many people argued gone home wasn't a game just not a good one i think you should do a combination good projects deserve love but also one sporadic supercut of bad to keep people warned it might work to have a few bad trailers at the start of each vid nope nope nope this looks decent hurrah you didn't call it the a s l challenge for knowing the actual charity's name heck look at people lighting up torches and pitchforks after spending just a few hundred dollars on a gaming box and dolla dolla bills yo also my shirt seems kind of relevant in this case too from several perspectives you're right on the first account many would argue about the nd the nature of debates is divisive what's the crest for that that actually seems interesting data yeah i wonder if there's some kind of metrics script for that using your phone can be dangerous even if you're not driving sorry mr snail liking youtubers isn't a problem either which leaves harassing as the only issue threat or treat simple yet clear marking of gluten lactose vegetarian etc foods good on you germany i know right you're actually complain about framerates and texture quality most of the time for me personally it's like a tv show i can relax to it because it's more passive than articles yet is not supershort quite an innovative new exclusive system just exclude yourself from a lot of games wonder where this will go you mean asshole culture within the gaming and internet audience right i'm pretty sure that's what you mean should the flooding work that way don't you need holes one for water in one for air out dual monocles and tophat for maximum gentlemanliness jim try monster rehab it's not nearly as sugary as regular about but it doesn't taste like deat i mean sweeteners unless your licence gets voided in which case you pay and personally i just wait for price drops and what if it gets voided before you managed to install play it was a hypothetical hence why he says at your own risk it might work fine it might cost you definitely think that you do can stop early a game has max minutes if it impresses you sooner good on it ooh this is pretty any info on how it's done looks like uprezzed render sure but any special texture approach what you're able to not hate someone you disagree with is this some kind of magic are you a wizerds it is rather uncanny just binge-read the entirety of s comic it's gooood with employees they're well past the dunbar number a group of is what our human brains can manage didn't know i a european could send emails about net neutrality to us gov europeans unite i've always likened dear esther to a book or movie you can press play pause but you don't really have any agency personally i'd love physical media as an option if it were just that but most games nowadays are just a dvd steam code next bundle you have your own npc and you're giving out games conspiracyyy he's an author at destructoid he is games media conrad thanks for making the distinction,,1614

aint kno mud i'm sorry but after reading that ched seemed to have an intention to go into that hotel room he lied about his reasons for needing a key but ultimately the question is should consent given when intoxicated be seen as being reliable accountability is important anyway we will never know if ched is really guilty or not very important to note the receptionist stated some footballers booked the hotel room the stigma attached to being a public figure may have been the deciding factor for ched as far as the law is concerned he should know better but is that fair shouldn't we hold every single person to the same level of expectation public figure or not when it comes to the law right or wrong there shouldn't be a greater desire to punish over the other a man's livelihood is in

352,apple vs google the smartphone smackdown how the world works salon com coincidentally a recent french piece places busa's work in its historical context digitalhumanities the chair we have just lost seemed to be going in the right direction in that respect teiputsch keeping the community informed is not seemingly a priority for the plotters teiputsch believe me the only sane voting member present also feels blindsided teiputsch at board telecon on th i moved a vote of confidence in the chair which was defeated teiputsch officially there is no vice chair dan has argued that it should be susan it's not clear she agrees teiputsch much of what it says on that web page has been invalidated by structural changes introduced last year teiputsch my mistake the meeting was actually on the th thursday if that matters teiputsch result btw board is currently trying to agree wording of official statement by their fruits shall ye know them what exactly amazed you that it should be mentioned at all or that it should be mentioned positively just wondering the motivation claimed by those who engineered the teiputsch does not reference the chair's vision document which is why is such a way cool project i would love to but the current board insists its email is private i have asked for a public statement twice now teiputsch what are you two up to ostensible reason for voting against martin was nothing to do with his vision doc teiputsch sorry just back from dentist so going offline for a while and the winner is sfaics only three uk he institutions have registered for bob so far this seems a shame or am i looking in wrong place so how do you feel about the ubuntu boing-swissh what a nice way to spend the day i will check this evening to see how you got on wanna try that again without the typo teiputsch useful bibliog on digital forensics forensics tsk tsk are you saying that art is not real both are correct but the former is more formal i hope not though of course p will be along some day board or no board all those words and citations and not one measly picture rt a slight rant about poorly planned websites that also manages to bandwagon on the recent riots here's one for david starkie tx florian willan i don't like your tweet sir we'll teach you the professors way hugh cayless has some useful comments on teifuture on his googleplus but i dunno how to link to them from here anyone tx cut and paste the url how obvious and yet how quaint happy birthday bethanie u shd go back to bed more space for thoughtful commentary than here or fb tho i misheard prof elemental as saying i dont like your tweet sir first time round lovin it how's the move going good move come across professor elemental yet oops i meant of course the usual way i expect what are you on about i doubt julia meant imply that maybe she felt issues were being trivialised on twitter teifuture oh you mean trolling it all depends on julia's opnion of reality tv maybe s'one shd ask her hm yes rereading that msg it does sound like patronising exclusionist guff not good comms failure partly due to prev board policy of keeping all discussion confidential grr teifuture getting a bit sickly now though surely all v interesting extent of semantic overlap between tei core elements and html tags remains to be seen teifuture dayofdh seems to have fallen over victim of its own success clearly not visibly on the dt website tho chiz chiz was going to spend all day uploading photos to my day-of-dh blog but since it's bust has spent all day on instead was going to spend all day uploading photos to my dayofdh blog but since it's bust spent all day on instead but how are we to revell in yr fame if you do not giv link to intrevew chiz chiz emory university saves rushdie's digital data nytimes com rt data services a success story bit ly oo mvw according to jisc rin report sad that ahds is now erased from history now now boys if you can't fight nicely don't fight at all mt uninformed unhinged and unfair the monbiot rant well i've mown the lawn done my email dusted the desk tidied the kitchen suppose i'd better get on with writing next week's talks connected histories sources for building british history version britannique d'isidore brill radio archive sadly no progs pre or so but fascinating data set does beeb provide sparql endpoint is what i meant to say brill radio archive sadly no progs pre or so but fascinating data set obviously lunch wasn't good enough sorry all booked up now but looks like it should be fun oucs linked data and practical semantic web workshop i dont think so but will check nothing in digital form is ever finished it has said so on my home page since c uvashape i just have this ideological problem about paying to download things must get over it is that what we used to call an argument all funding schemes are fragile to a greater or lesser extent rt folksonomies et hypomnemata num riques some useful thoughts on tweeting in french uvashape almost certainly yes if the bizness model works and so it does provided you got to it on a bike wouldnt it be more interesting to know what proportion of the historians are dh faculty uvashape acc to y wilks noone bothered to tell bill that iws was coming to oii are hrionline texts in tei hm i think ian l is only nearly right humanities is traditionally the reinterpreter of great ideas not their custodian uvashape so you've given up on nexus already i love the way the boundaries of this term humanities are shifting as rapidly as those of sustainmibility were yesterday uvashape skim-reading yr talk reminds me to suggest dh projects wch dont expose their tei sources shd be strangled at birth skim-reading yr uvashape talk reminds me to suggest dh projects wch dont expose their tei sources shd be strangled at birth conjecturator seems close to corpus linguistics and closer to authorship studies i e main stream old skool llc uvashape i'm even older than him and i probably

oxford linkeddata workshop about to start after excellent intro from j tennison gautier poupeau la gazette du web de donn es loadsa links to follow here sting in the tail for poor academics tho depends on your mode of transport but in principle easy years ago we came out of a crisis meeting on the demolition of the humanities computing unit to find the world had changed in other ways dr who meets semantic web the mythology engine representing stories on the web google is getting antsy the chronicle of higher education right that's the essential sorted out then dhhh is your digital data archivable cines has a test for that more than half of french phd students don't actually finish their thesis wonder what british is and they ask me why i like being in france looks good tho i am sure i've seen quite a few of those sides before but how did you get them into vimeo at dhhh willard indicts the usual suspects for not meeting his high academic stds methinks writing history is about taking revenge here's a really neat way of detecting dodgy stats tx vanhoutte at dhhh seems to believe there are ontological distinctions amonst disciplines which are independent of socially constructed ones my hypothesis is that the term humanities computing was closely associated by b'well with oup at that time dhhh interesting to see which hc foundational texts edward selectes

alphabetize all day worktweet i never meant to hurt anyone i just didn't want to hurt anymore either the lonely stoner seems to free her mind at night fuck the past few days i could really go for some coffee right now but i think i'll settle for a bowl instead yeah you too pal could be one of my catch phrases brooklynborn toll bridge trolls need to eat too today the paychecks come in and even though i can't deposit until tomorrow morning i can't fucking wait seems like i should have my jawboneup back finally boo yah upgrading my room she always calls right when i'm getting ready to leave for work lol word aight then shaken my ass while i hit the bong cause it makes me feel so damn good there's still some hood rat in me time to slip on something a little more comfortable and hit the bong don't need saving cause there's no salvation for a bad girl and a half hours till i can get back to where i wanna be cabin in the woods fuck yes to this movie simply that fuck yes elysium was pretty cool oh my god i wish i could figure out what i did to my left shoulder arm cause it hurts like a motherfucker i hate these games do what you will looks like i'll be taking the bus a lot more woke up to some static and stress rewind think im'a wake up to a bowl instead see what he had meant to say is when a child is bad but what he had said is when a person is bad ey neighborhood rules apply you ain't seen nuthen you ain't heard nuthen you don't know nuthen thingsisayatwork over the hills and far away she prays that he'll return someday as sure as the river meets the sea back in his arms he swears she'll be nothing to do for the next hour when you don't even get a goodbye and you don't hear from someone all day i guess they realized i don't have shit to do either so they sent me home early right after my bus left so now i'm waiting minutes for the next bus wow fuck you and your bad manners so ready to be home already i'm just blowin in the wind ready for the worst well i feel sufficiently stupid whatever i'm done bothering for now almost put my stuff i'm the wrong grinder whoops lol i'm smirken sooooo hard fuck that laughing this deserves a bowl it's so damn glorious coughing my ass off the i'm getting high alarm is sounding decided to make a coconut pastry cream tart topped with mango pineapple papaya lychee etc for mom's birthday sitting here trying to figure out what this all means i'm just gonna sit here and wish you missed me too he speaks in terms of centuries time to get ready for work made the arrangements for my moms birthday like a responsible adult still got minutes before the market opens so i can grab the last of what i need just enough time to get high i am in love with this baby pink lipstick i just got yesterday retail people love me when i go into a store i know precisely what i want exactly what i'm asking for and i've already decided to buy it today is my mothers birthday queenleo allhailthequeen time to get my ass up and back on track but first this message from our cannabinoid receptors whatever so glad to be home and reaching for the bong i'm so tired but got so much to do trying to remember who i was fuck yeah new ghost adventures today ugh put my favorite lipstick through the wash still usable though but really lesson learned trust my least favorite manager to fuck up my chances at catching the bus that would have had me home already at least they were teaching me to serve beer and wines today up late up early a protein rich breakfast before i smoke a bowl getfit my goals have evolved i don't give a fuck how tired you are this is where anxiety can take you insomnia sleepplease soooo sore and exhausted i'll just be grateful i'm hereto hit this bong and that i've got this bong to hit i'm in so much fucking pain can't decide if i'm gonna just hit the bing and grab on to some sleep or grab some munching a first i'm leaning toward bong truth there's a piggy off my coast of the bed snuffling for skritches thc then protein then get stoned out of my mind morningswithmcfly increasing my intake i'm tired of not being enough new gac just in time for me to enjoy before i head to work yes yes yes ugh can't even right now it wouldn't even be a big deal if i wasn't so fucking hungry i can now serve beer wines and some of our signature cocktails started at the bottom but i'm coming up like a beast i missed my intended early bus so i hit the bong instead ughhhh my luck haven't even gotten to work and i desperately need a shower and to wash my clothes already if that says anything about my day so far the good thing about having luck like mine is its helped make my outlook this it's a bummer for the first seconds then there's not much point in anything but laughing it off and planning the next step nice karmic turn around though with a free bus ride the stench of red bull dozed on the mat for a good minutes living down the block from the high school means i get to listen to the marching band start fucking up bright and early had my protein and got started on cleaning the kitchen it's time for some rips before anything else though reminds me of you i feel sick right now i'm just gonna hit the bong and forget work hours later than i expected shazam damn it's cold in my store wish i hadn't forgotten my hoodie today god my head is killing me maybe i should eventually eat something today i think i put my finger on what's bothering me work in hours ugh can't figure out why my eyes keep tearing up these past weeks,,1113

406,things i want for my business cards but are too expensive pms colors colored edges soft touch finish raised spot uv cut corners painters produced their most highly valued work when they were years old so i've years left for mine your new discussion layout is confusing regarding who says what because the comments aren't sectioned off i never really understood why game environments which you see most of get so few resources compared to characters k and on a gun fine but throwing the same on an enemy that you try to shoot before he gets too close guns using the texture already in memory is good guns on the floor having the same model as fps isn't probably lod models i'm talking about chars that are small scale compared to enviro props extreme example tri scene dammit crendor you broke jesse's game and made the audio go poof totally your fault i liken esther to a movie you can choose to progress or not but not affect much else but really grey area gamers unfazed sale has arrived the tiniest prices finest of prizes gaben be praised discounts shall thrive indie gamedev i don't want to be bound by publishers and marketing-tests indy gamedev games are an artform they belong in a museum mbit here get for in the netherlands previous contract since or was same speed on the flipside half games for half prices happy new years with an appropriately times new site just played the first two episodes of quake again game's still tight loving the smooth movement so apparently paying a month for spotify makes me worse than a music pirate dafuq wanted to say i appreciate the choice for minions should make the game feel nicely crowded and give bad players more fun heh i think it's funny you're apologizing for sound quality that's still better than say of youtube game voiceovers i know this is cool and serious science but it had me giggling like a kid best of both worlds working on refining my logo to chamfer or nor to chamfer that is the question c to protect and infect youtube i don't know a whole lot about network security but enough that this scares me silly spotify white zombie judge dredd soundtrack rob zombie blue man group okay then thanks for mentioning the hearthstone open beta i've been anxiously waiting but hadn't gotten any emails about it yet do you perchance read jezebel the timing is rather close i am so sick of people on twitter complaining about a bunch people on twitter helps to have a map no no it doesn't remember the time you paid grand for celebrity fashion without airbrushing pics so do these people steam's down wonder if that's because of the new music stuff play this now tomorrow during lunch whenever it's only minutes but it's awesome first time i bought a key for dota treasure chest baby roshan pretty sweet deal hah that shit's golden telltale are you still looking for people i can free up some time and be almost completely dedicated the next month s i threw up some isometric examples at assuming you want to stick with the rpgmaker perspective not many developers companies would opt out of lots of money because something's addictive i respect you for that now that's a proper free to play dungeon keeper i like this how do they not help i find it very useful to know if a game has been designed for touchscreen controller or kbm remember that fake twitch-lol video from this afternoon here's a real twitch-plays-dota channel thanks for reminding me us to disable adblock for places i regularly visit because it's often a fairer trade that tv radio mini metro quite a novel idea build your own growing metro system not sure about longevity replayability though how about keeping the same root word and call them bullvids coil because of its several experiments mirror's edge because of its absence and whichever game started radial menus crysis consider that a free game thrown in by the gods for your generous purchases luft means air not red and rauser probably stems from the dutch verb rouzen playing wildly or razen rage storm did you guys just change all your youtube video thumbnails or have i not paid proper attention lately do you also know about is this april fools or did they really start a website on april st with the plan of confusing people on every anniversary whelp wanted drama he got drama can the devs get a nice game jam now since that's what they wanted game jam great april fools joke anita sarkeesian receiving gdc ambassador award for making videos in two years time for a moment i thought i was reading about a game from your avvy is now black red white does this mean future content will be in betrayer-vision hey i wanted to inform you that potato dungeon seems to be borked right now clicking to ride pard doesn't work for me anyways not fond of new design discrover shows less per page and the menu bar shows less lines so i must scroll to get to my playlists it's a carefully planned deal he asked both for the exact same amount so he's raking in cash but staying neutral combine any random music term in youtube it probably has it raprock acapella metal industrial jazz celtic chiptunes gregorian dubstep i feel like i can express myself less right now it's all white will there be a way to change style besides just link color harold and kumar walk down the aisle because racial inclusivity of course just crashed in to more bugs in minutes on the bike than in the past two weeks of game development goddamnit i hate it when a commenting system forces you to first register but meanwhile doesn't save your typed post lookingatu is the new ui broken or just badly designed i can no longer sort albums or search queries by name artist album length rating yes but only cool people might be cool for portfolios horizontal scrolling single page template also on github html css i wonder how many people realized what horrible things they sometimes say good luck best wishes and dump that lump just rode past some kids biking km for some i guess that's pretty healthy in the end if you sit like this and stare past your crotch it probably is but only barely here's hoping this will wake people up a bit about greenlight early access kickstarter right what you're saying is you're now opening a p o box under the name of cynicalcox you hypocrite you closing down your p o box for other companies but still accepting bribes from polaris bias bias yay mustasch jim is in fact a drag king in real life he is an ethereal spirit but for his shows he dresses up as a man the point is not better because harder but balanced against lame exploits it means you actually think engage with the game this should be enough energydrink for at least two days bad pixel shirts are one of those things that annoy and bother me more than they probably should so what do we call this kind of review score hate strife out of ten good old gaming a store kinda like steam origin but aimed at retro indie more than aaa u s healthcare it'll cost you an arm and a leg either way get the spambots under control please and here's yet another one more spammers clean them up no but i can reccommend you a great shirt turns out you should not attempt to run km barefoot when you haven't done so in three years ouch whoa whoa whoa not just a black baseball cap one with a very iconic stitchy liny logo thing half-life no no carmack made doom quake rage half-life is from why is there something wrong with them are the ads too silent to hear for you we are not having that issue going to try and get something done for lowrezjam days left so it's gonna be tight but i know what i'm gonna make a x fighter i'm not seeing the problem with that lowrezjam workfile looks perfectly usable as long as everything is in nice sprite strips i'm happy for small stuff like this panning around is easier than tabs windows face pulp actually i should probably have scaled up the image p heck i'm working small enough to make the game i'd like to know which devs you consider upstanding trustworthy what with nintendo greed watchdog graphics and indies such as towns and that recent plane game air control who do you like still i just spent an absurd amount of time playing with this remarkable online sid keyboard emulator while your point is true you're not the best advocate lots of women feature their looks notallwomen the times when your dog wants to eat the rotting half-corpse of a mouse and you have to pluck it out of her mouth hey i wanted to check if you were aware of this pixel pig game using your artwork good vid but missing one element presentation host as much content as possible have curated lists of the best the new the interesting and so on make it easier to navigate empowering critics users not curation but promotion navigation wow this was great i love simple games like these that require very little time complexity to convey a strong idea oh no is offline as are the forums sound the alarms sound the alarms the concentric pattern makes me wonder if dithering could make the layer transition more natural looking with facebook in your future does this mean we might finally get a legitimate desktop version of whatsapp,,1652

best way to win for rcb allow the opposite team runs splendid hirni will post photos soon end of day and end of journey what is full of some wonderful views cannot post now aas no computer is available had a very loud and provocative alteration with someone i really respect a lot when shall i be able to control i just lost my cool forget n forgive while in roaming osn is the best way to communicate just too much heat taking its toll feeling exhausted still felt good to be back in wb seems so much at home back home just enjoying doing nothing monday blues now i know it must recover

be i need it most hello and good morning heavy head feeling and not a hangover i swear i didnt drink i need some pure rest i guess ok start the day with a disputed statement people say they are modern but they allow others to be modern only sometimes i feel good to be busy but at the end of the day i really feel very weak it feels good when you are surrounded by happy faces none likes others to cry i wish all my friends gets happy good morning the first question remains what is so god about this morning feeling so tired mentally and somewhat physically as well that i am not in mood to get into any more trouble please leave me alone i need a govt job so no headaches no burdens no workload best part long idle times copy paste cholchhe cholbe feeling weak n hv to keep going for another hour

hitting the road again always liked the journey through national highway at night even it is on chhote log chhote batein eventually made time to hear my fav singer's song with full concentration and getting the meaning sheer listening to my two fav singers of bangla and english enjoyed the the journey apart from the pollution saying welcome to kolkata back to semi normal life but surely need more rest than anything else really weakened by the virus cannot sit for long how to treat someone who calls you when you are fast asleep with fvr this is what i could do best,,1485

you're drunk as of today i've got over games on steam and about i've never played never gonna get rid of this backlog am i hey i just saw you on kickstarter i saw the game logo and immediately saw a cool ambigram possibility i never thought i'd be amazed by tearing crumpling paper siggraph d looks like sony is winning the e this year e ps nodrm usdollars you're aware that the vast vast majority of the u s doesn't have exactly great broadband either nodrm summer sale on torchlight for free games off daily deals up to off ooh and game-sharing might be on steam in the future nice stayed the same no gone down because inflation you should know that mr bachelor's if you play just the campaign you're not buying all the dlc maps packs are you which means that if the price stays the same back then now with less value per dollar games are lower value cheaper we want games to be better if we go for cheap as the primary factor we end up with clones free-to-pay and social-exploitation r i p douglas engelbart father of the mother of all demos we owe you so so much just installed the new opera browser version dear god all the features are gone it's like going from word to notepad t t just bought the huawei p via really great deal at shipping included this is a pretty interesting game based entirely on talking i wanna have a game out and playable by januari there i've said it it's out

universe for hinting i should back-up more often thinking about consoles in with sony's ps dev tools launch games will look better but we'll see less improvement over the lifecycle well this is dumb if you make a bad game suck up the criticism and make better ones via not wasted time though more like a psa it's good that you show us the worms in the can at times so far just been using it for a

cutest deadpool cosplay wow dyscourse sounds similar to something i'm making down to oregon trail and walking dead as inspirations might wanna look into this hotmail says the newsletter is shifty i

446,hello and welcome to the my name's and the following is written by david thorney thorney ney nei tho thoreau thor thor i don't know if the e is silent welcome to the where we report obviously having your own monkey would be a fantastic idea because they're quite intelligent and yet unable to speak they have the advantage of learning quickly through beatings while being unable to tell anyone below is a list of the kind of monkeys that would be good to have the list is far from complete as it omits jet ski monkey boiling water monkey battlestar galactica monkey but covers the basic best kind of monkey there is disguise monkey monkey that wears a disguise if i had a monkey i would borrow my mom's sewing machine and make my monkey a little monkey suit then if anyone said that's not a real monkey it's just a monkey suit i can see the zipper i could say i bet you fifty dollars it's a real monkey and when they say that seems like unreasonable but you're on my monkey would take off the monkey suit and they would have to pay me fifty dollars and i would buy drugs with the fifty dollars for the monkey so that he could live with himself for having to live inside a monkey suit all day gambling monkey monkey that likes to gamble if i had a monkey i would teach him how to count cards like dusting hoffman in rain man and sneak my monkey into a casino and if anyone said that's a monkey whose monkey is that i would say that is not my monkey channel changing monkey monkey that changes channels if i had a monkey i would teach how to use all of the entertainment equipment i would save money on batteries for the remote controls by having my monkey change the channels for me with the money i'd save on batteries i would buy drugs i would share the drugs with my monkey while we watched black books and stephen chow movies surveillance monkey monkey surveils if i had a monkey i would teach him to track down people who annoy me by using their profile photo and google maps using an earpiece to communicate i would have my monkey conceal himself behind the person typing on facebook and when that person wrote something stupid i would have my monkey run up and slap them on the back of the head really hard and then make a quick escape having several monkeys would be more convenient but i don't have time to train seven monkeys with having to do my own hair in the morning and all web monkey monkey on the web if i had a monkey i would teach it download porn for me this way i could spend my time watching it instead of looking for it i estimated this would save me a hundred and thirty seven hours a week i would obviously require a monkey with similar taste for mine but how hard can it be to find a monkey with a fondness for pregnant german women in latex monkey monkey monkey monkey monkey that's my monkey final summation having a monkey sounds like a lot of fun in the comments below what would you train your monkey to do i bet it's dirty o ho o ho the best comments are going to make it onto the next show and i love you have a wonderful day muah kisses to your mom because she knows you know that i know that we know what we both might not know lord,,614
447,hey you guys um i decided for this video i would be holding a christmas ball i just took it off my tree because it broke and um it's kinda plastic a bit stupid but i just thought since christmas is coming up soon that i'd you know my video that's uh that's my attempt all right let's start off this with um a little recap um i haven't made a video um in a while so i guess this is time to you just talk a bit more about what happened last week and the week before last and my views on it sadly a lot of really good acts have actually been booted off x factor um names such as lucie jones lloyd daniels add danyl johnson all really good contestants but i don't really think they made the cut and the finalists now are the ones who really deserve to be in there and are the ones that are definitely the best but i was still very sad to see those three go um when i found out that john and edward um were kicked off i was really happy because every second when i saw them perform i died a little inside isn't that sad last week after watching lady gaga perform bad romance in her awesome devil costume and starting off in a bath that apparently was from simon cowell i uh placed my vote for oli i am about to place my vote this week for oli myers thank you for calling the x factor and be with you woow go myers all right let's talk a little bit about this week because that's probably the most important thing at the moment um i sadly don't have my tv yet um actually that's for my tv when it comes it should have come a couple of weeks ago but it still hasn't come damn can't wait and um this is my tree and our stockings and i kinda went off the point but anyway um yeah so basically uh i watched a couple of performances on the itv channel four for x factor and um i was really disappointed last week was amazing all the acts did brilliantly they sang really well i was wanted them all to stay in cause they all did so fabulously but this time it was terrible they did just terrible so yeah stacey was kicked out big deal she did terrible i liked her her first audition and she went downhill from there she just wasn't that great i don't like her personality it's too corky and funny and cute and really really hyper it's like she's always constantly fueled with coffee and caffeine and whatever other stimulants i could i could think off but i can't anyway it's like she had a tube in her puffing and she's always so hyper it pissed me off so i'm so glad she got kicked off um but yeah i think oli's going to win i'm sorry both oli and joe have got a lot of support however joe is younger less experienced while oli's older smarter cooler better and just way more appealing than any of the other competitors since the whole show started um so i'm really hoping he wins all right now it's your time to get video responding and commenting on this video please tell me what you think um about this week's uh shows last week's shows whatever who you want to see win the x factor and who do you think um would be like the best record producing artist out of all the expected contestants because already lucie jones and lloyd daniels and john and edward have already still are pretty famous even though they already got kicked off which was um inevitable because liked them anway,,644

450,hey everybody it's monday july twenty seventh two thousand and nine and that means it's time for another edition of governor palin's back in the news this week as she transitions from alaska governor to alaskan citizen pending all power to lieutenant governor parnell she had a few choice words for the media it is as throughout all alaska that big wild good wife teaming along the road that is north to the future that's what we get to see every day now what the rest of america gets to see along with us is in this last frontier there is hope and opportunity and there is country pride and it is our man and women in uniform securing it and we are facing tough challenges in america with some seeming to just be hell bent maybe on tearing down our nation perpetuating some pessimism and suggesting american apologetics what and we can resist enslavement to big central government that pressures hope and opportunity be wary of accepting government largesse it doesn't come free and often accepting it takes away everything that is free melting into washington's powerful caretaking arms will just suck incentive to work hard and charge our own course right out of us uh wait is that no way what she made a good point there at the end but sometimes i have to wonder if i'm listening to sarah palin or nicholas fain in other news over the weekend i heard the story of troy anthony davis do you know who he is you should mister davis was sentenced to death for the murder of an off duty savannah georgia police officer named mark mcphail back in nineteen ninety one davis was convicted solely on the testimony of nine eye witnesses since that time three eye witnesses have recanted admitting that they were coerced and two other eye witnesses admitted that they never even saw the murder take place despite a wealth of information that has been presented to the court and some new evidence yet to be presented mister davis remains on death row after eighteen years for more information about troy anthony davis and how you can help in his case check out iamtroy dot com that's all i've got for this week for everybody i hope you enjoyed the show because although i started recording on monday july twenty seventh it's tuesday july twenty eighth and that time has come gotta get out of here for work new work schedule so until next time keep checking out dot com for daily blog posts updates and etcetera and meet me back here monday for new video or thanks for watching,,446
451,hello everyone it's hi this morning i enjoyed watching your one man's opinion video and you may be surprised to learn that i have no disputes no disagreements with uh basically anything that you said but i think that where and you can tell me if i'm wrong where our opinions might begin to diverge is what happens after you try your best at being a bootstrap kind of guy uh and you fail i mean we all know what happens if we work hard and if we are successful and we can take care of ourselves life is good but the missing pieces what happens when things awry now oftentimes it's through no fault of the person for instance somebody loses a job and in turn loses their healthcare a person who gets sick and gets dropped from his coverage or a person who has a preexisting condition and can't get coverage at any kind of an affordable rate i mean what do we do with people like that people like that who by the way could be you could be me no one knows what tomorrow will hold and we in most of my videos uh i like to note that i don't necessarily try to be persuasive uh to get people to see my point of view or to change to my point of view i happen to be a persuasive guy so that just happens but it's it's not the intent normally what i'm trying to do is you delve into a concept something above the the fray something above the raucous misfit uh that's normally the political debate for instance in the healthcare debate everyone's talking about things that have nothing to do with healthcare itself so you know diving into those things doesn't really do any good i'm trying to get above that and you know maybe talk about things that are important to people that might be something worth talking about and that's uh when i was watching your video i started to think you know we we all feel proud of being american it's a great country but what are we really saying when we're saying we're proud to be american is it just we're proud of our achievements do we care at all about those who for whatever reason are having difficulties to me the country being a part of the country is akin to being a part of any other community and any community whether it be family friends neighborhoods it's not uncommon for there to be an outreached hand or to try to help those who have a need this particular discussion about healthcare it's really scary to me that those who have healthcare now like myself settle that they're okay and they very well might be today but we have to think about what will happen tomorrow now and the insurance companies have thrown a whole lot of money into derailing this and unfortunately they're being successful and i touched upon that in my last video but i've got to think that people should be more should be more foresighted and see that this is not a debate only for insuring those who do not have insurance it's a debate to try to make the entire insurance business one that will not run us into bankruptcy and i think that as a country we should pull together to fix what is clearly a broken uh system some things i'm a capitalist i assure you and i'm out there trying to make money like everyone else but some things do not work within capitalism alone governments have a place hopefully it's to do the will of the people and also to do the right thing even if sometimes it's unpopular as was the initial uh vote on social security there were many people who were saying saying things they're just saying now about the horrors that would happen they were saying the same things then that they're saying now and none of those things happened it indicates looking back on my whole life i know that someone gave me an opportunity deserved or undeserved someone did it had nothing to do with my abilities or my will or my perseverance i could be the brightest guy in the world which i'm not but if i were i still would need someone else to give me a chance someone forgave my youthful indiscretions my youthful impertinence someone thought it was a good idea to provide education for our young someone decided it was important to build roads someone also thought that it would be a good idea to provide health insurance and healthcare to people americans when they got old someone decided to build to build systems for clean water and systems to dispose water through sewage these are all things that an individual cannot accomplish so for those who say that government has no place i think that's wrong now what happens sometimes is that this process gets corrupted and consequences ensue which you and me are not happy with but i think it's not even debatable that there is a place for government and that there are many things that individuals the best and the brightest the luckiest whatever category you want to put them in cannot achieve on their own so i believe that now is one of those times just like when we built the roads or the water sewage we should find a way to fix the healthcare system to find a way to be good americans and take care of one another bye bye now,,941
452,so um ehh i don't know i don't know what else i can say i'm just too fast you little fuckers and when the thoughts goes goes too well just letting the thoughts come rolling i saw nine inch nails live my favorite band i saw you know i saw nine inch nails my favorite band live back in november november the fifth to be exact uh right after the election that was fucking amazing concert um i think i'm going to call this video the most random shit ever just the most ra i know i okay i know shh quiet i know a lot of my vids are already pretty random but seriously what to talk about so many things in the world to talk about so many things well fuck politics i don't know shit about that or economics or any of that stuff i mean i i can say i know a little bit about what's going on but i'm not gonna get into it that was never my intention to start up some blog start up some blog where i just chat about you know things that i don't know shit about so uh in other words i don't know enough to talk about them or encourage it you get the idea i'm not even looking at the camera when i talk i'm kinda looking off into space i gotta stop that i'm not even looking at the camera need to just stare at the camera give it a sexy stare just kinda you hearing that sound that little chukka chukka chukka chukka can you hear it chukka chukka chukka chukka those are my legs they're shaking to and fro but they're not shaking out of perverted purposes perverts or pedophiles you know who you are made a pretty pointless vid here i mean this is very very terrible this is a very terrible video and i'm very sorry just keep talking and talking and talking i'm gonna have a fucking terrible time editing this shit out when i wake up or whenever i do this um oh yeah i'm going to go at well i could go i could just write it down but i guess i'll just say it before i forget about it i think i orig i originally started the video camera started the webcam with the idea of getting this thought down that way i could remember it and go back over it just uh some of you may consider this terrible or whatever but some of you may consider it making fun of our of our of our troops you know of of the of the american troops not going to say our troops don't give me that don't you give me that i don't own these guys no i don't i don't and i'm not into this for but i'm not getting into politics okay i'm staying away from it tonight um yeah i realize they're humans and all that but okay anyway anyway okay so anyway like i was saying you know god bless the strong and brave men and women your stand around hunter while he's high god bless our troops standing around them i just kinda thought you know i was kinda thinking to myself about that like seems like whenever i'm a little out of it or you know due to probably some substance or whatever well i guess i'm never really safe to be around in a certain sense it's not like i'm just going to bust you up all a sudden but you know you're obviously not going to have the best dreams after hanging around me for a bit anyway so i'm talking about you know like if i'm a little out of it due to a certain substance or whatever um anyone anyone who is around me you know who is actually brave enough to stay around me um for fear of my you know just going too far um i gotta give you credit gotta give you lots of credit and pats on the backs lots of pats on the backs lots and lots of pats on the backs i'm getting to that point where i'm not really i i'm actually pretty tired but oh man i could go to sleep but i kinda think i wanna stay up for a bit i'm actually waiting for a gift by um by trent reznor or by nine inch nails they have it up on their site and iam com they have this thing up there since the seventeenth i think it is um saying you know we may have a new video we may whoa you know we may have a we may have a little hol we may have a little holiday gift for you soon check back so you have the word may you have the word soon where you have those words and it's just those words are so uncertain last time they said soon it took what two weeks you know two weeks for something to pop up on the site um and then may it's like a well that's i mean trent is very committed to his fans and iam is very committed to the nine inch nails community of course um but you know when you say the word may it's kinda like well i may edit this video tomorrow but then again if i'm saying i may wait hold on bless me thank you thank you so much such a great great person but yeah it's like i'm saying i may edit this video tomorrow um you know i i uh i may not edit this video tomorrow may is is half and half that's like saying well you know might do it might not either or um but then we got em to say may do it soon that's kinda like well i might do it in the near future or i might not you know might take a long time it might never be there it might actually be there pretty soon and considering it's a holiday gift you know i'm thinking okay let's see what time it is well it's about two forty five here which is fifteen minutes of course til that is a quarter til three um which means that it would be midnight over in california by that point and that's where nine inch nails is basically located right now in california which means their new year's would strike and the new year would strike and um they would um that would be the other that would be another opportunity for the whole holiday idea cause christmas already came and went there was no gift you know but now this is new years so maybe a different situation so i'm kinda excited about that i might stay up for a bit long tangent there very long i know but well i love expressing myself,,1167
453,hello so i'm keep looking at myself um i just saw the new lady gaga video for her song bad romance and uh i have to say i thought it was actually pretty pretty cool um there was a few things that i want to address though um there's this part where you see her spine and it looks like when you see the video you see her spine when she's like in the shower thing or whatever and that just kinda freaked me out a little bit just saying um and she was wearing alexander mcqueen um the shoes from his most recent runway the devil's hooves as i call them i thought that was pretty cool that she did that and um let's see i love how it looks really good quality right there but i'm pretty sure as soon as i upload it it's gonna look all gritty um just gonna go for it um hmm uh yeah okay back to the video i'm just trying to collect my thoughts um i just i just saw it like maybe five seconds ago seriously like five seconds ago i saw it and i was i just had to make a video and tell you that i thought it was actually pretty good and i didn't really understand the concepts she was like a vampire prostitute who was being sold off to the highest bidder and then she kills him at the end by setting him on fire is that the concept or is that what the plot of it is is that the synapsis synopsis synopses um yeah i'm sorry i'm just i'm really bored i didn't go to school today cause i didn't feel good and um twitter was all lady gaga bad romance so the video just premiered like today so i well on youtube at least i've never seen it on tv then again do they really play videos on tv anymore not really but um overall i thought the music was really good um lady gaga doesn't really have that great of a range in my opinion but i thought she did some really interesting things with her voice like a whole part i thought that was pretty cool but um yeah i don't know just overall i thought it was pretty interesting i don't want to say like its amazing or anything but i don't want to say it's terrible i just think it's pretty interesting and um that's all,,417

458,okay guys so what i learned today about governments and civilicness uh yeah okay well it was a two minute wikipedia search like and i've learned what fascism and socialism are because i really didn't know and this is what i've come up with okay socialism is advocates an economic system where everybody does work and all the resources all the profit gained from that work that everybody does is available for everybody to draw resource from so let's say we're a socialist beet farm you know beet farming community and we all farm beets and so we make a big pile of all our beets and everybody gets a fair share of beets i mean that's that's what i got fascism and this is also fascism associated with social darwinism kind of is how i'm this is my perception of it that fascism is when i forgot it slips out of my brain so fast how does it happen um fascism is when it's this whole i don't know what i got is it's this thing where you know they think the weak are puny and the strong are the best and everybody should be strong and strong versus weak because the world is always in conflict or something and as a as a nation as a society we should be as strong as possible which i also i i i think you know this might be like the darker side but nazi hitler side um even though hitler was a nazi not a fascist or is he a fascist i don't fucking care about hitler so um you know i was thinking that one race is the best one group of people is the best you know they decide what the strongest is so that's different okay i'll put some wikipedia links on the side over there under you know but uh yeah so i'm gonna put some links to the wikipedia pages cause i think if we all use wikipedia we'll be super smart or at least on the same page like seriously cause even if wikipedia's wrong if everyone believed it it'd be right for all intents and purposes it'd be right so yee yee yee i don't know i feel like doing a dance a dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance dance pepsi ah pepsi cola okay guys go take care of the government now go fix things be citizens congratulations i don't know go get a green card or something i'll see you all later,,423
459,it's been it's really late and i should be sleeping but i have nothing better to do well i do i could study but i'm not gonna be i got back from a um rock concert at my university i bought um ministry of magic and um it's in my computer but i bought um butterbeer experience lena um her new beetle the bard cd of stuff and uh rock opera yes um yeah so here're some photos and some footage i took at the concert really think you'll win i am your waking nightmare the chill it chokes your spine i'll flood your veins with venom the boy who lived you will die waiting watching voldermort darling can i fetch you some water yearning burning voldermort please can i help you with something i am the dark lord and i am looking for the i am the dark lord i feel like i have to preface this next clip um the sounds went out it kind of threw them off for a second and then they just went on without the music probably my favorite moment of the night it was pretty incredible here's the clip ohwee why does that sound like a munchkin now i've got a job to do woah wooh now i've got a job to do cause i'm finally on our own cause we're finally on our own we've gone away from home we've gone away from home we'll never be alone never be alone we've got a place to call our own to call our own finally on our own far away from home never be alone on our own in sorrow in sorrow in sorrow in sorrow in sorrow i think that part was they were all so excited that it was going to be warm it was florida and it was supposed to be warm but it was freezing i mean we were all frozen like solid like i couldn't move my toes because i was so cold i also wore my converses which probably weren't exactly the most uh insulated shoes it was pretty fun like everybody was into it it was good even though it was a smaller crowd then they probably expected we floridians are not used to the cold we cannot handle it so yeah yeah yes there's a chopstick in my hot chocolate i'm finally done with all of john solo books the book before last book was the last one it was really good i really enjoyed it he kind of tells life as it is i've been uh recently amused my t shirt and my little uh sonic screwdriver doesn't make sounds but it goes nee okay i got problems it came with my journal of impossible things that i am a crazy fan haven't gone through it yet but i will um what else that's it here's some other random stuff my dog,,489
460,i know it's been a couple of weeks but i've been really busy and i was just on vacation this last week so i haven't really had the time um but the other reason is because the past like two or three weeks before this week when i went on vacation i actually wasn't doing that well um which i was really scared to tell anybody because i have not done that in over a year so um i was really ashamed of it um and i didn't you know do terrible or whatever um it's just since i started la weight loss which has been over a year now i have not cheated on my diet at all i have not eaten anything that i shouldn't um and about three weeks ago i don't know what happened but um i started eating a lot of peanut butter and that basically became my addiction for a couple of weeks i would come home from work and just kind of eat peanut butter out of the jar and i was i would think it's okay but it wasn't because i would keep eating it thinking oh you know it's just an extra spoonful here and there but i would end up eating you know a few extra tablespoons every day for like a week straight um so really that was the basis of my like bad weeks was eating a lot of peanut butter and then i had one day that i ate too much i had two extra bowls of cereal i had an extra dairy i had um i think an extra starch and maybe one more thing but that might be it um and so it's not like i went way over board i didn't like you know stuff myself i just um ate too much that day and i haven't done that in over a year and i'm really ashamed of it so um but i wanted to tell everyone because i'm obviously not perfect and you know i think it is okay to have bad days it's just i haven't had one so i'm not okay with myself doing that i don't allow myself that and but i'm over it i'm past it now because um this past week i was on vacation and i really wanted to like start again like you know like no more of that so i'm on vacation and i had the most amazing time and i got to hang out with to which i will put his link in the sidebar um he's awesome and i had such a blast hanging out with him um i also met like in arizona her link in the sidebar as well and ah love her just as much oh my gosh we had a blast which i will hopefully be soon in the next week or two putting up a video of that footage of my vacation but um had a great time and i didn't eat anything that i shouldn't um i had frozen yogurt three times with however um i didn't eat a lot in that day and we were walking a lot and we hiked and so i think it was completely okay um so but ah yeah and so before i left on my vacation i was about one ninety four something i think on my last weigh in that i posted i was one ninety four point eight and that was about what i was um because the last you know few weeks i was just maintaining between one ninety three and one ninety five so when i left i was one ninety four point eight and um this morning when i got home i was one eighty nine which is awesome because ah i've never been in the one eighties and i it's a really good motivation for me to get right back into gear and you know get this like i want to be one sixty for my ultimate goal which is only you know thirty pounds away that's not a lot i can do that and i have new motivation i have new um i feel a strength inside of me to really just do it um and that's my plan so my plan right now is just do it i want to do it and you know i agree that you know it's not like it's a race i don't have to get it done really fast but i want to right now i'm so motivated right now and i don't want it to go away i just want to focus and do it and be at my goal and simple as that so that's my new goal for the next ah i'm going to give myself i think four months well not give myself but am hoping within four months at the end of four months i'll have lost um about thirty pounds and ah i think it's doable and i have a friend that's gonna you know do it with me so cause she has basically the exact same amount of weight to lose so i'm really excited for it um but now i want to tell you about my vacation how awesome it was i had an amazing time i flew to arizona with my mom where my grandparents live and i was there for a few days and then um after that we went to the grand canyon and then after that we drove up and we went to yellowstone oh no actually we went to arches first which is really cool and then we went to yellowstone and then we drove home i live in minnesota so we kind of went up and to the right whatever um it was amazing and i did a great amount of exercise which i will tell you right now right so the first day i was there i hiked up a small mountain with my grandpa which was amazing um it took him like i don't know i was out hiking for an hour or two i think like two hours and we had to climb up to the top except there was no path at the top so we just had to climb up rocks and you know be very careful because they were like some of them were falling and there's cactuses so i had to like dodge them and i got my hand poked a few times and it was an amazing feeling hiking up there and climbing down and hiking and just you know it was a great exercise the very next day the next morning actually at like five thirty in the morning i got up and i went for a twenty mile bike ride with my grandpa and his little community friend which was beautiful but awesome and great exercise and then within an hour had picked me up and um we went to another mountain to go hike up which um unbelievable because that one it took us about three hours to do it took us about two hours to get up to the top and then an hour to get down approximately um and it was amazing i didn't think we could do it and we stopped a lot well i had to stop a lot he has incredible endurance i don't know telling me to stop a lot and we really should keep going and we're just like we got to do so we did it and it was beautiful and i can't believe we did it we hiked up to the top of a very high mountain and it was amazing and uh it was great and it was a great workout and uh i'm just so proud of myself and um then the next day we didn't necessarily do like exercise but we walked a lot we walked to the grocery store we walked around his campus we walked to the mall like we did you know a decent amount of walking so that was pretty good and then the next day i was at the grand canyon and i walked two and a half miles around the rim of the grand canyon which was also beautiful and then the very next day the next morning i hiked down a mile and a half into the grand canyon which wasn't too difficult but then i had to hike that mile and a half back up the canyon which was very difficult very hot very tough very steep incline wow very very hard then the very next day we were at arches and i hiked i think it was um it was about two and a half miles just hiking around different trails and up and down you know hills and what not and arches and getting to arches and what not and so that was that was a good day cause it was very hot and it was tiring and i ran a little bit it was great um and then the next day when we were in yellowstone i did a little little tiny bit of hiking but not much it was really cold and i was driving a lot that day so i don't really count that but um i was very active on vacation and it was amazing and i think that's why i lost about five pounds this vacation so that was amazing um but yeah i will hopefully make another video um soon about my vacation what not um and yeah i i really hope that by next week i can hopefully maybe be down to one eighty seven that's going to be my mini goal i'm really motivated and i really want to do this um and i think i can so yeah hey everyone i'm here and i'm finally making an update,,1658
461,i'm back hey guys sorry i haven't made a video in a long time it's just my computer is broke you can tell by the graininess of this video that i'm using my parents computer and i might have to do a lot of cuts if i make any videos until my computer is fixed because this will only record one minute at a time and if it records over that then the video and audio starts to go out of sync and then it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse so and by the way i got a new look since we last met i have changed my whole look i've decided to go from wearing just a plain t shirt and jeans to actually layering my t shirt and a new hat yay yay to new hats it gives me bad hat hair though but it's a cool hat yay hats so this is just my saying i'm sorry it's taken me a long time to get this video up and i might be back depends on how good my editing skills is skills is my skills are depends on how if i will make a video or not soon i might and as you can see i'm not in the best of locations to make a video and i live with my parents so they might also be a factor on whether or not i can make a video soon so yeah i guess that's all goodbye for now wahaha bye,,256

464,hey guys it's wednesday so i thought i would just do a quick uh bloggedy blog and kinda do like a little thing um but basically i was trying to think of different video ideas and i came up with one that i think could be uh kinda fun um so i moved to chicago in june right but i never really have any time to go exploring throughout the city feel like i don't really know this place very well yet so i thought that i could do like a scavenger hunt and you guys could name off a bunch of shit that you either want me to find or go do or whatever and then i gotta take my video camera and go around the city and find all this shit um so i think it could be really fun so i definitely want you guys to list some shit for me to find but uh things that i will not find no matter how much you beg of me first being drugs i'm not gonna go find any drugs of any kind so don't even bother begging also that includes drug dealers i don't have any interest in meeting up with any drug dealers as well as for prostitutes i don't have any interest in finding any prostitutes at all so yeah so i'm gonna take a friend with me and we're going to do around the city and do that i want to do it before christmas though so just name some shit as soon as you can i guess um in the meantime rest of my day today i'm gonna clean the fucking room cause it's a mess and then i'm going to do a heliopsis photo shoot tonight uh for those of you who don't know it's my brother and his uh friend michelle it's their etsy store so that could be kinda fun um so yeah so name a buncha shit then i'll go around the city it'll be fun and yeah i hope you guys are having a fantastic day and i will see you guys later bye,,356
465,hey what's up this is um it's been about three or four maybe more months since i've done a video blog and i figured i would do one um i know if you watched my other videos you'll notice that i got a different setting here i got myself a house so this is just my little computer area uh that i got set aside so that door opens when my cats are out there and they meow constantly and i don't want my video being full of meow meow meow meow so i figured that i got a lot of hits and a lot of views and a lot of comments on my itt tech rant so i figured i would do a follow up to that and tell you guys what i'm doing and what i found out and everything so apparently there is two types of accreditation national and regional all your regular schools like university of huston university of miami you know cornhuskers sooners all that they're all regional all the technical schools itt tech and stuff like that they are all national it doesn't seem like that would be right it seems national would be more important but that's not the way it is okay so i searched for high and low for a school u of h told me up yours you know south west texas state laughed and said you might as well just start as a freshman live on campus uh no okay so my mother is a student currently at kaplan university as an online school and i hear i can hear the moans right now going eh online school no that's a rip off it's crap let me tell you it's not kaplan is the real deal um i am proud to announce that kaplan accepted my degree from itt tech and i am now enrolled officially as a junior in undergraduate program at kaplan online university and i'm getting a bachelor of psychology studying behavioral analysis now i know that some of you are like what it gets worse a minor in history so here is the deal i am going to be a high school teacher i will wait for the shock to set in i know what i look like it's a curse okay so i'm a be a high school teacher when's the last time you had a spring break exactly okay i actually do care though it's real weird i'm not really sure why i care i haven't really come up with a reason but i care so being a teacher sounds awesome besides all the holidays and the two months in the summer that you get off completely wow besides all that it just sounds so fun so i want to teach either some sort of history or psychology class or sociology so the way it works where i live is you don't necessarily have to have a degree in what you teach but you have to have twenty four credit hours minimum in that you know subject so the way kaplan works is the last six courses you take are electives and you pick from a list of like five hundred classes i'm not even kidding like twelve accounting courses everything from typewriting to html code to pharmaceuticals to law enforcement to constitutional law i might take that especially if i'm going to teach history right right well some of the courses i have to take for the psychology degree fall under the history category i only need hours in one subject so that frees up some more electives i also have to take physical science which is kind of shocking to me i also have to take statistics i can't even say it statistics there you go statistics i am so done so anyways the point is i get credit for all this in fact kaplan takes my itt tech so much that i'm actually don't have to take intro to physiology because i took it at itt tech when i went to itt i had to take physics one two three and four english composition uh you now basic computer skills i had to take sociology and psychology and government and economics it was really weird but so they are giving me credit for all that i'm a veteran kaplan has a department just for the military my academic advisor has a degree a bachelor's in psychology perfect uh the price okay the price is three hundred fifty five dollars per credit hour but if you are a veteran it's two forty books all other fees all everything is included in that price i'll be done in eighteen months eighteen months i'll be a teacher pretty much i gotta take a teacher's certification course after that but i'll deal with that when i'm done with my degree but i'm telling you i think you can just yahoo kaplan it's spelled with a k k a-p l-a n they didn't ask me to do a video they didn't they don't even know i do video blogs or nothing i'm telling you that this place is i know it's legit because my mom is going there she has her degree you know um i mean she's getting a master's from there everything is really cool i mean you take two classes at a time the last six of the whole school you get to pick from the list from whatever you want they send you your books for free if you have access to their florida big huge public library they'll actually mail you the actual books i mean it's just too good to be true and let's say later i want to take this degree and go get my master's at like university of huston they are the exact same accreditation they would absolutely be accepted i mean the school district they told me that kaplan university is on their list of places they accept the school district told me that so i found my place i'm a be a high school teacher i don't really know if i um if it set in yet but we'll see what happens you know um so anyways i hope that this is informative uh if you went to itt or you going there or you've go or you're alumni just check it out kaplan if you are not happy with itt tech and you are currently going there i bet you if you call kaplan you can switch to the online and whatever classes you've already taken at itt will transfer over i got out of intro of psychology because i took it at itt anyways i'm look for much more in the future and i'm gonna stop try to stop cursing so much because if i'm a be a teacher i can't say fuck alright thanks for watching peace,,1156
466,hi youtube we're back it is friday september the fourth which means this weekend is labor day weekend and and will be here so they're actually already in town but they're just getting ready and stuff so we're waiting for them decided we should make a video just to let you guys know what's up chloe had her six month shot on i think it's wednesday so two days ago and she did really well she didn't even cry this time so i'm really proud of her what else seventeen pounds fifteen ounces she's a big girl and um what else she has a little bit of a cold right now just a runny nose but other than that she's doing great and she just crawled this morning not very far just to get a toy but she crawled so that's the important thing right chloe um say hi everyone say hi what are you doing she's kinda busy tearing everything apart at the moment throwing all my stuff off the desk so i guess i should be going um me and will probably have a video for everyone up soon of our kids together chris and chloe and until then have a good labor day weekend and i hope everyone's having fun or camping or doing whatever so have a good weekend and i'll see you soon bye,,229
467,now after you have all that all in the same bowl you're gonna beat on low with egg beaters obviously and you're going to beat this mixture on low until a dough begins to form and once the dough forms you'll know that it's ready when you squeeze the dough with your fingers and it sticks together that means it's time to make the cookie shapes hi again and today i am gonna show you how to make some chocolate gem cookies and it's actually another martha stewart recipe but it's really really good so i thought i'd share it with you guys and what you'll need for this recipe is two cups of flour a cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and the one i got was hershey's because i dunno hershey's was pretty sweet um you'll also need one fourth cup of unsweetened cocoa powder so that's if i didn't say that that's what you need and one fourth teaspoon of salt and you'll also need a cup which is two sticks of unsweet unsalted butter at room temperature it has to be softened and three fourths cup of sugar and one teaspoon pure vanilla extract now that first step that we have to do in order to make these cookies is sift the flour and the salt and the cocoa powder remember three fourth cups all into one bowl to make this awesome powdery mixture and i don't own a sifter so i'm gonna kind of like you know go a little crazy and try to whisk it to you know a powder mixture i hope this works so it'll work i'm so if you don't have a sifter you can just whisk it and with that always make a mixture just mix it together now the next thing you're gonna do is put your two sticks of unsweetened butter in this bowl and mix it until it's fluffy and like on medium for about two minutes after you've done mixing the butter together to make it all fluffy that's all you need i've finished with a spoon because you're supposed to mix with a paddle but i don't have a paddle so i finished with a spoon and it's supposed to look kind of like this really fluffy and soft you add the three fourths cup of sugar and continue mixing for another two,,397
468,mmm it is so freaking hot here my armpits smell like a at the concert there i said it dad and it's not as hot as darwin but at least in darwin most people have air conditioners and you can sleep at night without sweating at the moment i'm working on a remix for witlee it's a competition and if i win i get twelve months worth of free entry into all due process concerts or whatever i don't know what it is but i'm going to win it i'm competitive now i decided that yesterday we'll see if i can eat this ice cream before it'll melt can i eat it up i see a lot of um those commercials on tv for abc three starting on december fourth it makes me feel sad but also very happy for people who got the jobs it will be awesome if there any abc three people who are watching i'm in sydney and i need a job yeah i actually live two streets down from the abc building and i go past there every day on my way to school and go huh i have thought of infiltrating the place wearing a lobster suit but then my sister told me lobsters are dangerous looking so why not dress as a bear although i think bears are rather dangerous depending on the kind of bear my last bit of ice cream that was good that was really good actual gelato in fact i got it from the farmers market across the road why not listen to the remix i'll show it to you lets rock play it please we are here it seems we are always marching it seems dark like here nothing ever seems so clear so clear well that wasn't a real phone call i was just making the whole thing but you know you thought it was real didn't you anyway let me know what you think of the remix it's just like about a minute of it but i really don't know what to do next i have a feeling that's the end of the song but i made it first so i really don't know what to choose for the beginning i'm good making things from end to front no it's not you may have noticed that there's no what's on anti news things today i feel lazy today so there's not going to be one there wasn't one last week though so there's not going to be one this week but there will be one next week maybe or i must just have one special one for it if something completely ridiculous happens in the town in that time like that time that there was a three hundred person brawl in katarina square i actually went and looked it up and it was only thirty people but my sister told me it was three hundred people i would hold her to that because it sounds way more epic yeah that was totally awesome,,507

a sense a kind of veteran and i know how things work on youtube not really but cause i've only made eleven videos but it's it's kinda cool one year yay by the way in case you haven't noticed this video is in my opinion anyway significantly better from the other videos partially because of my wonderful new lamp light okay this might this is gonna take a little bit of effort all right random book shelf i know yeah it's wonderful oar poster but that lamp and it totally lights up this room great instead of my mini desk lamp um and i like it but i don't know where it's from don't ask me um but i really woah sorry like the lamp and i hope that it will jesus sorry stick around for at least for a couple more videos um yay lamp yeah i'm making this video for a total of three reasons two three we'll see three i'm gonna go with three three for now three reasons one because it's summer but with summer comes as all children high schoolers kids know summer work and this year instead of just getting to read whatever i want which is by the way now totally seems great um i actually have required reading and i have yeah and i have three books one two three three three books i have the wonderful one second a distant mirror by barbra w tuchman which i am currently not even close to half way which is how much i have to read um i would recommend this book if you are either a a historian or b a social studies teacher otherwise i'd pretty much steer clear of it it's quite hefty i don't know it's weight in pounds um but it's quite big and i don't carry it around with me i read it here at my desk um and it it's it's interesting it's really in depth like i really have a lot of facts that i didn't know and now i do book two how to read literature like a professor by thomas c foster this book significantly better um in all seriousness it's actually really interesting um i am going into an advanced uh english and social studies course so hence reading literature like a professor and um he makes it really really interesting and teaching me about symbols and and everything that you need to know when you're reading a book and i actually have literally chuckled and laughed at how witty and humorous the some sides of his are like for instance he talks about shakespearian quotes and he just has all of these random like quotes and i actually chuckled when i read one i don't know what play this is from if somebody could help me out with what play this is by the way drop a comment um exit let me see if i can get this exit pursued by a bear and i literally stopped and i started chuckling almost um because i just thought that that's kind of funny i mean book number three the once and future king by t h white quite um quite hefty i mean it's six hundred pages of solid reading um i'm actually enjoying this i'm on page what am i on i'm somewhere around page a hundred and seventy a hundred seventy or so and i enjoy it i mean i i don't like king arthur i don't like arthurian fantasy but i like fantasy um i have i don't let me just grab this um i have multiple like dragonlance and i don't know how many people know dragonlance dragonlance box sets this is one of the three that i have and i like fantasy and this is kind of along the lines of that and it's really good so i'm enjoying that um yeah reason two i wanted to talk about music you know music like the kind you listen to on your ipod um in the bus and the car on the train on a plane um because i haven't really expressed how much i like music on tv now i know some of you are going to be like totally w t and his bands but um i just want to say i just want to give you guys an idea of what music like i listen to or enjoy listening to and you guys know um with the state radio poster on the wall walk past the office counter poster on the wall and on the wall i'm kind of a college conference i'm i'm sorry okay college rock kind of advocate fan um i like dave matthews band a lot um i'm not even going to get into how much i like dave matthews band actually um i also like a band i'm going to snatch this you've seen this before trust me i'm and this is the set list the original set list from um um april fifth april fifth april fifth two thousand and nine the acoustic show yeah all right they handed it to me off the stage along with the pics which i keep right up on the top of my desk with the set list um and also like this band not many people have heard of this band totally um what's recommend sorry recommend this band gomez great band um how do i describe it blues india rock grunge that's kind of the way to describe it um i wanna see them i didn't get a chance to see them when they came to terminal five in new york uh a couple months ago um i'm i just gotten in the well i didn't just get in to them uh i kinda been my dad interested in them my dad the dead head my dad my dad if you've read about them on my blog you know a little bit about my dad um he introduced me to gomez i actually knew the words to some of the songs before i even knew the titles it's the same thing with dead songs like i know the words i knew i knew the words samson and delilah before i actually heard samson and delilah by the dead or them playing it anyway and um i like gomez a lot um i've listened probably to the song hangover be my like five times today um so check your gomez and check out check out state radio check out um i didn't think i said um yeah obviously you know what dave matthews band does i'm not gonna play any of dave matthews band because of copyright ooh and drum roll please reason three i wanted to throw the idea up in the air to regular viewers all six of you um i wanted to do a little action whatever i'll finish this in five minutes i wanted to make a live show i wanted to do a tv cable live broadcast and i wanted to go on blog tv i know i'm talking really fast but just stick with me and you can probably understand what i'm saying i want to go on blog tv and i wanted to do a live show i thought it would be a lot of fun and i wanted to know if you guys would watch if you guys would advertise for it if you guys would invite friends to come to the chat room and talk about stuff with me um i might even have a contest or two i don't know um comment comments comments comments um because i really wanna i really want some feedback on this and i really would like to do this idea but i don't know how many people would watch it or how many people would actually benefit from me doing this so um try to comment because i really appreciate it and i really want to do this so let me know if you like the idea if you have any recommendations any sort a thing i'm flexible but the broadcast would probably be on a friday or saturday night because i have a life kind of that's all for now i'm also running out of tape and i literally have one minute of tape left because i just used something i found something out for somebody else um so that did it this is that blogger kid signing off okay thanks bye hi it's and i'm one years old year one year,,1476

472,hey guys so i went shopping the other day and because i wanted to avoid all those horrible things that happen to people who pay with cash on those debit card commercials i of course used my debit card but you know i realized that with all the things you have to input after you swipe your card perhaps cash is faster after all your total is twenty three seventy four all right um i'm just gonna do debit so i'll just um swipe beep beep oh right pin number beep uh no cash back beep okay that is correct beep my sister beep i don't see how that really applies beep what but seriously though sometimes it's like playing twenty questions with those things and not only that but um usually when you swipe your card you swipe it at the wrong time and then the cashier looks at you like you're a dumbass for trying to pay for your shit um anyway though uh if you read my blog you'll know that i've been working on a little ep and i've decided to release it november twenty third uh the ep obviously two songs that i've already done are on it uh in which i've made music videos to and plus a remix of and three other songs that i've worked really hard on and am proud of so to make things a little more interesting i thought i would hold a little contest leading up to it on november twenty third so all you have to do is you follow me on twitter my twitter is just twitter dot com slash and i will be giving out from my last video i have a ton of them so i'll twitter something like the eleventh person to reply to this twitter about my ep will uh win a paper crane and then if you're the eleventh person i'll send you a direct message and get that sent on to you so the link to my twitter will be in the description and also a link where you can find more information about the ep i'll be making a music video to one of my favorite songs that i made on the album called and that'll be out sometime soon you'll also be able to download the ep on like itunes rhapsody all of those music download sites and hopefully i'll also have a physical copy that you can actually buy i'm also planning a few other special things for it coming out but more about that later um that's it for now so bye guys,,437
473,so this is a quick video response to youtubers exposed by regardless of this video in the negative things he has said about me in live shows mr is probably one of the funniest fucking people on youtube realist i'm not going to say that no um but funniest yes and his ability to handle the internet audience is something to be admired because mother fucker oh my god do a lot of people believe the bullshit coming out of your mouth and you know a lot of it is true a lot of it is true but when you are talking about people using everyone that uses question of the day post on a regular basis saying that makes them sane that makes no sense posting on a regular basis has existed ever since there was fucking media if newspapers came out randomly i wouldn't know what the fuck was going on i know that in the morning i can go up to the newsstand holy shit there's a newspaper right on time i guess that makes me stupid that i got a scheduling shit that when i turn on the radio i go oh shit the mj morning show is on that shit is not randomly popping up it's seven pm and the question of the day is misused by many a person because they see people using it and they're like holy shit that works i didn't invent the question of the day it was invented by the first person whoever had an opinion who wanted to know other people's opinions and it has been bastardized on youtube you make a video it's like do you like turkey check yes or no in the comments below because it helps my video that rhymes yay and there's a lot of shit that goes down on youtube that pisses me off but you realize that it's part of the game and you've just got to deal with it or eventually those people will fuck up there are a lot of people who gained an audience doing bad shit there were people spamming people with messages like hey remember me subscribe to me or like back in the days when people fluffed their views like smp films using a video reloader it wasn't him it was a friend doing it another thing that got me was when said you know all these fake mother fuckers but youtube needs to feature people like charles trippy and timothy okay i love those guys but if i don't see a video that they posted with some sexy thumb nail title of hot chick does blobbedy bla bla bla i am shocked and they are playing the game just like anybody else the summary of this video is yes it does annoy me with the shit that goes on with youtube is it everyone no but yes it does annoy me when people cheat or at least in my eyes cheat like a child that gets their videos audio spotlighted because there's a dude that works for youtube that has invested in that company the way i have justified it is everything is kind of bullshit even you coming off as the savior the man showing you what is behind the curtain while he has an ad for macdonald's to the right of his video but i do enjoy you videos even though your white voice mr and i really wish you would post on a regular basis because those mother fuckers want to see your videos and to you guys watching this video if you are one of those people that's like phil has taken the suspension and he's doing this and if you're that stupid then just unsubscribe to me it's hard to do on the internet but i would like to minimize the amount of stupid fucks watching my show or continue watching me and hating me because haters pay the bills that's just something on my mind see you next,,670
474,hi it's i just got back from my trip this weekend i feel so bad okay so i come home and first of all my camera bag did arrive fine but yeah i was worried i was getting this thing from amazon vine and um somebody would steal it like if they would steal a book on humanor if they would steal a ukulele why wouldn't they steal a camera bag the thing keeps this bag thing is bigger than my suitcase i'm like what i'm suppose to put ten cameras in it what what i don't know i have like sort of a professional grade digital camera that i got last year cause i'm crazy i don't know and some different lenses for it and stuff but i'm like i could put my camera and all the lenses and like my lunch for the next week in it and probably my cat it's china kitty anyway i feel so i get the package and then of course i come home to my cats and like i'm usually gone for for two nights in a row and i feel so bad that i'm not there in that sort of that middle day to like give them some extra moist food and stuff and i feel like i feel like um she like she wants the attention but she's she's like i don't know she's extra extra she's extra claws when i when she's mad at me and i think she's mad and she's so skinny like i really noticed it when i have been gone for two nights and when i come back and i swear she's lost another like half an ounce or something which for her it's a lot yeah so i have a little china kitty here and she's kinda being sweet and she's kinda being mean i think she's mad but isn't she cute aww she doesn't like that very sad yeah so we went to this wedding i think i had to do another like ten more things to do when you're broke video cause i thought of some more yeah but i don't know if some of those things are good like i was talking about weddings i was talking about um you know you can go to a wedding and you get free food and everything but you know my boyfriend and i are vegans so we were really lucky because we know the mother of the bride and she was really sweet and she said oh i'm going ah she said just like the day before the wedding uh let me try to get you um the beef entr e without the beef cause then you're going to get like potatoes and vegetables and stuff where there was a pasta entr e that was like cheese lasagna or something and so we couldn't eat that and she actually remembered to do it so it was awesome but then it was like hey hey no fighting no fighting come here rodney come here come here because you're so cute and we want to sit together and we don't want to fight with china oh you're so warm so cuddly so cute yeah he's like so excited yeah we're excited rodney we're excited and um yeah so uh she managed to switch it but we drank maybe a lot of wine probably because we were a little bored no i mean it was a great wedding it was like this fairytale cinderella kind of wedding really nice but just like just boring enough to drink a little too much wine maybe and that's fine to do once in a while i guess unless you don't have very much food so when you just like have a few vegetables and a couple pieces of roasted potato like you haven't really had that much to eat so after the wedding we ended up going to safeway and trying to find some vegan friendly food and this is the bad part because you see i was vegetarian for twenty years and i did spend some time along time ago being vegan too and i read food labels like a maniac so if you want to know vegan junk food like i can tell you vegan junk food and part of our reason for eating vegan is to eat healthy so what good is it to know what junk foods are vegan like you know what kind of cookies are vegan or whatever it doesn't do you any good so we went we got a bunch of crap we went and got a bunch of crap yeah so um yeah my point is what good does it do to go to a wedding and you know like you're getting free food at the wedding but then you're vegan uh yeah it doesn't doesn't do much good and then for just total humiliation like i brought this dress to wear really nice dress and um i saw that it was too small for me yeah because i am too fat i was too fat to wear that dress so we went to an outlet mall and my boyfriend bought me a new dress which looked quite similar to the old dress only it was a size larger and not as nice it wasn't as nice of a dress it was very similar it was almost the same only not as nice and and with and ugly neckline but um he bought me this dress and a purse actually the purse is really nice and now i wish that it wasn't in my luggage because i would show you the purse is awesome so i totally scored this cool dressy purse even though my video camera doesn't fit in it very well so that's not good but like look china stole my spot oh so sad yeah so humiliating dress didn't fit had to get a new one wasn't quite as nice and my boyfriend is like you have to wear nylons because or stockings whatever because they look nice they look so elegant and whatever and i'm like well they're not comfortable and i'm already wearing body suit i have to wear the nylons and put the body suit over it and i'm like not comfortable and he's like sometimes to look really good you have to suffer a little bit and i was thinking of my mom cause i don't know what she used to be doing like if my grandmother used to be doing something to her hair or whatever it was and my mom would complain and and my grandmother would say well you have to suffer to be beautiful my mom would say well i don't want to be beautiful and um yeah it made me think of that but uh it made me many things it made me think of that but uh i guess it is all a matter of balances but then you look around and you see people that look very nice that maybe aren't wearing nylons and you're like you're thinking like i think he just you just don't have to wear them in california or something what the heck why am i wearing these silly i don't know i'm not sure if i agree with like the whole you have to wear nylons thing ever in california i think there should be a law passed against it i would totally vote in favor of the no nylons no stocking well stockings are okay but no nylons no nylons but we discovered this awesome noodle bar and we're like now we want to check out every noodle bar in the bay area cause we're like noodle bars rule and we went there twice and um what else we went to lodi on the way to sacramento and we went to load eye again on the way back and uh on the way back was really cool because the second winery we went to the owner of the winery was there and he was just like a total wine geek and he was like you know i guess he though we were pretty cool so he was going running in the back and like getting barrel samples out and bringing out for us to taste and stuff and it was just and the wine was good too so that was awesome and um yeah oh oh we went to shevi's tonight shevi's what the heck i don't even know why we pick shevi's i had like guacamole which at least they make their own guacamole from scratch right at your table that's kinda cool guacamole corn tortillas which i like except that the ones my boyfriend make are like a hundred times better and um beans black beans that's what i had and oh like a margarita the size of my head like gra grande a grande margarita way too big actually i didn't even finish it yeah and uh yeah and i have really been perfecting the technique of keeping my boyfriend awake when he's driving because i'm never driving on trips he's the one doing the driving but i am like the master i just keep him awake ah yeah currently i need more better songs on my ipod nano though now that we have the cord to plug that into his his car if we both sing along to songs on on there it uh it really keeps us awake it makes the time go really fast i'm sure we sound completely ridiculous but it's fun right yeah so anyway now we're looking forward to halloween we've got halloween coming up and we are totally not ready for it and i'm freaking out i don't know about him but i'm panicking i'm panicking hu hu hu and i think that i might have volunteered to spend the day at his house putting up halloween decorations i mean that's cool you know like we had to take a client of his out to dinner and then the next night or no his business partner and then the next night his accountant or vice versa and i said well maybe in between i could stay at your house and put up halloween decorations but i thing that means that i actually signed up to hangout with his mother all day because she lives there and i'm like oh no are you serious yeah so that's going to be my week,,1760

476,hey guys it is week number three into my weight loss journey i hope you guys are still interested ah anyway i wanted to talk to you guys about my past weight loss so let's get started i made a little weight loss timeline and also graphs because i'm a nerd so i made a little weight loss time line here it is okay so i am a baby over here and then basically what i have learned is that every time i move to a new state i gained weight so i lived in texas when i was a baby up until when i was twelve years old we moved to ohio i gained weight because that's a really stressful time you're trying to make friends you don't have any friends it's just stressful twelve months later no it was sixteen we move to minne snow ta right over here oh right here so that caused some weight gain too because ha ha i just made some friends in ohio and then we had to leave so i comforted my pain with food okay and then over here i went to college in wisconsin sin as my sister would call it and that caused some weight gain because that's college stressful as you also saw on my timeline i had world war one and world war two not exactly um i had weight watchers one and weight watchers two okay so take the challenge get a pedometer if you want um they are wonderful to help you lose weight um they recommend you if you want to stay fit you walk six thousand to eight thousand steps a day if you want to lose weight they recommend that you walk about ten thousand steps a day in which part of those ten thousand steps i think you have to walk walk four thousand in one go so a big walk um that's basically what i'm going to be doing i'm going to be trying to get to ten thousand every day except for today since i just picked this up they are not very expensive this one was seven dollars at walmart there were five dollar ones but this one i opted for because it has this little strap because i have bought so many in the past that i they fall off and i lose them so this will catch it if it tries to fall off of me so i'm going to try to walk ten thousand steps starting tomorrow it will be awesome um next week however i might not have this video up on time it's going to be a little late probably a lot late i'm going to be driving back to school next week it will be awesome i'm going uh the problem is my school is ten hours away from here although it will probably be twelve hours when you count chicago traffic weather and everything else so i am going to go which ever day is going to give me the best driving conditions um depending on the indiana toll way and the most of wisconsin so that's that it will probably be a day late so because i'm thinking i'm going to go head out on monday so yeah um i want to hear how you guys you guys have been if weather has been great or if you new to this to say hi i would love that that's about it i will see you guys next week and have a wonderful week,,594

478,inglorious bastards the new quentin tarantino movie that came out on friday but i saw it on saturday why because i'm bad ass so i kind of figured i'd do a review right now but i'd like to add in that it is one in the morning so if this is not the greatest review it's because i'm freaking tired anyway let's get started so the main thing that attracted me to this movie was the fact that it's a quentin tarantino movie and i'm a huge quentin tarantino fan um right now i'd just like to say em it was he did a very good job in the film it was all well done stuff like that um but i wouldn't say it was his best film because a lot of people out there are saying that this is one of this is his best film he's ever made i beg to differ it was reservoir dogs just saying but it is indeed one of his better films that he has made so just throwing that out there now let's get off with some of the goods and the bads so one of the things i loved in this movie was brad pitt's acting because his accent was it his accent added humor and is just a really good accent and you know his he made the movie funny but also was he did really actiony and stuff like that um kind of jumbled up right there but his acting in general he was great in it that also leads to one of those those flaws and to me it seemed like he didn't have that much screen time because you see him for about ten minutes and then you don't see him again for another half hour um he probably had about fifty minutes screen time i i can't remember how long the movie is i know it's at least two hours but i know it's a good thing sometimes when you don't see the star that much because it adds you know more screen time for people that are unknown and stuff like that but um with his acting when his acting is that great you kind of want to see him more i guess so ah that's just one thing um one of the other good things about this movie was the screen transitions like it wasn't just a bunch of random stuff happening but the screen transitions were well placed they were well laid out and stuff like that um that also kind of led to something else like um a really good good scene would happen um i don't want to spoil too much but like a really actiony scene would happen but then it would jump into the next scene and the next scene would be kind of boring not that great um but some of the scenes were stretched out like there was unneeded dialogue nothing really important happened um for example this is a minor spoiler for people out there the tavern scene where they're um all dressed up like nazi's and talking to that um one of the in command guys for the nazi army um like maybe five seconds of the entire scene were important to the to the rest of the movie but the rest of the stuff was just thrown in there not really needed like they spent thirty minutes taking about random stuff and then another thirty minutes playing a game and i i found it kind of boring and i had to like i almost kind of fell asleep during that scene but trust me it's worth it to watch it if you've seen the movie already if not go see it but that comes later um another good thing i liked and i keep saying that it's been kind of repetitive but whatever um was the chapter format like it's like it's basically like literally a moving book because it'll say chapter one and then at the end of that chapter you'll see chapter two and stuff and i just thought that was kind of cool because it's like kind of like a book and that that that goes back to the screen transitions because it was like you're just flicking through a book and reading it that's i liked it i'm probably weird but yeah um going back to brad pitt's acting though the humor in this movie was great it was well placed too there wasn't too much humor and there wasn't too less humor if that makes sense um brad pitt's character was the funniest but a lot of one liners came from other characters during really serious moments so if you're really tensing up and feeling that something's going to happen there's going to be at least one good one liner that's thrown in there that makes the movie funny it's kind of like a dark comedy because it's kind of hard to make world war two funny and all the jewish stuff that's going on but yeah the humor like i said the humor was good they um actually i thought this was more of a humorous film than an action film and that's kind of saying a lot being that it's a war it's a war movie but um so this this this is one of brad pitt's greatest movies that's what i think but i haven't really seen a lot of his movies but it's definitely his greatest film in the last five years at least um but moving on um this one is just a bad thing um the subtitles because three um french is used in the movie german's used in the movie and obviously english is but he had to use german and french subtitles um the subtitles were good but it's like they'll be speaking french and then the subtitles if they say like merci or mademoiselle they'd actually put down those words they wouldn't say they wouldn't put what they actually mean in english but then sometimes they did so it's kind of confusing because sometimes they do and sometimes they don't and i just thought that was kind of weird maybe they could have worked on that just a little bit more but yeah so like i said fantastic movie i really loved it um final rating i would give it a it's a really good movie i really recommend you go see it right now it's not as gory as you think it would be but hey it attracted me so take a look at it guys it's definitely one of quentin tarantino's best works so yeah that concludes my one in the morning review i'm going to get some freaking sleep goodbye,,1133
479,all right well uh turn to your textbooks in uh page twenty yeah now the thing we are going to talk about the spaniards and you guys know the spaniards were they were catholic you know uh i went to a catholic uh school catholic school uh you know but i was cool i was a cool catholic kid you know i had dreadlocks and you know i i wore rusty colors it was i was the back in the day i still am you know i can skate board you know because you gotta get serious because you have a p test that means you have to pass okay something i hate about my school hmm this is going to be a long list so i'm going to spare you guys and i'm only gonna name one thing my school is a uniform enforced school we have a uniform dress code fun i know and um you know they're pretty strict about it i just i hate it because they actually pay people to stay at the front gates and make sure you are in uniform because of that i also hate the faculty every single one of them even the teachers yeah one thing that i actually like about um my school is the schedule you know cause we our schedule is weird it's not just like one through seven every single day it's we have blocks so um every other day we have either the even numbered periods or the odd numbered periods so monday would be like one three five and seven and then tuesday would be two four six and eight yeah the classes are longer but you kind of just learn how to deal with them but it gives you more time to do homework we get more breaks and yeah okay see you guys next week or will i hmmm,,317
480,and then fill this one out for dinner a little pepper you whip it and have a great salad delicious so i kind of want to show you um a bit about what it took to make the desktop that i made for my blog i always make a desktop every month and i thought i'd show you a bit of behind the scenes um it looks like it's all like hand drawn and it is all hand drawn but a lot of the work and the composition is put together in photoshop so i'll show you each of individual drawings that's the main and it's just all done in pen and little frowny bits nothing special and then the flowers that went behind them see all i did was scan them all in and uh get rid of the background and photoshop and apply a couple of textures that i have and actually also did just a plain wash sort of background behind it and um yeah that's how i made it sounds like it just took just five minutes but it didn't it took quite a few hours actually um yeah it's very you like it and i like making them for you it kind of pushes me and helps me find new techniques for things and how i wanna draw basically in my old career i guess uh so i'm glad that people give me the opportunity to do and then they don't totally hate them you have a great night great day and see you um there was also nigel b canon's work which was great and also courtney broone she does the most beautiful like little pencil drawings they're really amazing when you get to see them up close so hi tonight i've just come home from the opening of my art show i made a group show called illustrators it's on a kiln gallery in poms in brisbane australia um,,326

484,hey what's up whatchya doing i'm not doing anything and it's friday and i should be doing like everything today cause i have no work tomorrow it's like the beginning of the weekend and no school or anything tomorrow but i have nothing to do really because i can't afford to drive to see my friends so i'm kinda like stuck here and it's really lame i have nothing to do so i decided to make a youtube video and um it's kinda a pointless one so i'm really sorry but i i didn't realize that um on my eighteenth birthday i got myself a present and i never showed you it's kind of um not showing up as much as it was but um this is it yep it says the used and it's like a copy off of um brandon a drummer from the used the old drummer from the used he had the same tattoo so i i had to copy it yeah yeah if i had a scooter which is what i want or a moped uh it would like fix everything even though it's like freezing outside right now i'd still take my scooter out and go to wherever the fuck i want because i don't want to be here right now i want to be with friends and um but i can't afford to drive that far it really sucks but a scooter would like make everything better so i don't even have like people to talk to online right now because normally i do normally i'm talking to people and uh i'm not like they're not on so i'm really bored i have nothing to do my sister's asleep would somebody entertain me this camera's not working doesn't like i don't know talking to a camera doesn't really entertain me all that much believe it or not uh oh yeah fucking gag me with a spoon jesus christ this video is retarded cat tiger i don't know if you've seen my cat tiger he's uh the one with the flat face you know he's a himalayan i don't i don't even know if you've seen him before but uh like he's dying it's a happy subject he has bone cancer and it's like this lump on his back is pretty gross and uh i asked my mom if i could have a cat a brand new kitten because i really want a kitten like really bad and she said not til tiger dies how fucking morbid is that yeah i had to share that oh my god i have to tell you we i'm really scared that i'm repeating a story that i've already told you but um i work at a bookstore right next to petco and at petco they had um two lizards a male and a female escape and they laid eggs somewhere but they don't really know where and randomly we got like this little baby lizard in our toilet and we didn't know there was like two lizards escaped and they're were hatching eggs it was the weirdest thing because there was just a baby lizard in our toilet like what the fuck so um my co worker grabbed it out of the toilet and went over to petco and bought a cage at her um aquarium and like a heat rock and stuff and now the lizard's name is toilet yeah that's my story oh but i have more work stories um fuck i don't know if i said this or not i'm really sorry if i'm repeating stuff um but one day uh my manager walked into the store and like walked to the back and somebody had like tried to pry open the office which is where we keep like all the money that's where the safe is and stuff and uh like one of the back doors had been opened and so somebody was in there at some point in time hiding in there when uh me and my co worker ashley were closing like somebody hid in the store and we locked them in and then they tried to break in and steal money like what the fuck and we figured it was probably in the bathroom but that's kind of a scary thought is it not like somebody was hiding in there when i closed the store damn it i keep having like random stuff to talk about but um people like to mention how i like rock back and forth or i i close part of my mouth or something when i when i'm talking to the camera it's all cause i'm really fucking shy that's all and i don't know i am a little bit more calm today my mom's not here so i don't have to worry about like waking her up or anything but uh i'm just really pretty shy i'm surprised that i don't stutter throughout my videos because when i get nervous i usually do so um you know about that part but i mean i mumble and i close part of my mouth sometimes and just like move around a whole lot and sometimes my hands are roaming crazy and i'm just like laughing at myself the entire time so i just want you guys to know that i'm i'm really fucking shy like i i'm scared to call people i've paid my sister to make phone calls for me i i can't go to like a gas station and talk to the person behind the counter for like more than like a second i can say like thanks and that's about it i can't like ever remember if i'm trying to buy gas and i can't pre pay i never like remember what pump i'm even at and like how much money i'm putting in like it's yeah and i say like a lot i know you've probably really noticed that way too much but um yeah um i'm i'm sorry about that part can't really help it but uh it it's all just cause i'm i'm really shy like i basically went through like i don't know all of middle school almost not even talking so i'm also a major dork and i can't believe i just admitted that i like didn't talk to people i mean i did occasionally but um there were definitely some days when i like almost go the entire day without talking now i'm just a really fucking emo and weird i'm a little better now um i talk to cameras i just made myself pretty much like die right now breathe all right oh my god shitty video number one thousand six the end,,1127
485,so on the internet i've always been really open about myself my thoughts my personality i don't let any of it i don't hold any of it back most of the time and that usually works out pretty well for me but it's gotten to a point where i'm starting to question uh not question myself but question how i act on the internet does that make any sense um facebook facebook has basically ruined everything for me myspace did and didn't it's much bigger with facebook because with facebook there are people that watch me on facebook that or that i'm friends with on facebook i guess that i knew when i was in like high school and some of them are my teachers from high school who really aren't that much young that much older than me actually but i went to a christian school and back when i went to that school i was really quiet i was shy i was withdrawn i didn't really take good care of myself i would i was kind of a slob and uh so a lot of people when they think back to me they probably have that kind of vision in their head and that's not who i am anymore i am not quiet i am not a prude i am i still consider myself a good person i still i'm still very spiritual i still love god but i have a potty mouth and i like bad things and i think i'm okay with that but but but i i originally connected my facebook to my twitter because my you know i was never updating my facebook and i thought the only way i could really update my facebook was if i connected it to twitter but i'm kind of paranoid now i'm kind of sometimes i i sensor myself i tone down the potty mouth and i i tone down the really stupid shit because i'm thinking oh man those people from all those years ago they're gonna read that and they're gonna think what the what the holy hand happened to her and and i hate feeling like i have to do that and apparently it's the same like the same way with employers now like anyone looks up my name they'll see all the stupid shit i do and probably they won't have the best impression but then the question then becomes do i need to sensor myself for these people to be considered good enough for these people um i don't think so i don't think i should have to but the question is still there and and so i'm constantly questioning myself should i say that should i say the f word should i say hell should i say damn will that offend somebody and have make them think less of me and why should i fucking care it's the fucking internet if you can't handle it get off the fucking internet i'm sorry i'm really distracted it's snowing outside it's houston it's snowing outside it's kinda freaking me out um but yeah um so what would you do would you try to sensor yourself to make because i mean there's all this shit i do there's my blogs that i do that i i plainly say my name is hi how are you doing you know all of my comics my really stupid stupid comics have my name on them all the stupid phantom stuff i do like the nintendo stuff the video game music it's all right there with my name on it and anyone who looks up is going to see this dork so should i hold that back or should i just be fucking honest and i've always felt that honesty was the best policy when it came to this kind of stuff but do should i clean up my internet image and keep the f words and whatever else behind some kind of lock so only certain people can read them but i hate that i hate the thought of not freely expressing myself so there you have it yeah let's go look the snow,,697
486,hey how's it going everyone um it's a quarter to six on monday um so i just put together a uh a clip from not too long into my program we had a special class where we got to experience japanese tea ceremony um and so i have a little clip at the beginning of what you're supposed to do when you first enter a tea room i'll show you that here in a second so there was only two of us that actually came to this uh even though there were supposed to be a lot more who were supposed to show up so we got into the little entryway the gankong and i screwed up and it's a different kind of gankong than in typical um typical homes this was a special tea room that was located inside the school so i go in there and i walk in the wrong place with my shoes on getting a little scolding moved into the tea room and little thing about japanese tea ceremonies they're interesting cultural historic they suck it's one of those things i'm sure i haven't climbed fuji but i'm i'm assuming it's similar to that it is something you do once to say you did it and then you probably won't want to do it again i'd probably rather climb fuji naked than do tea ceremony again primarily because of seiza sitting seiza uh sucks i thought i was prepared for this i practiced at home i sat on my carpeting now there's a big difference between tatami mats and carpeting because basically tatami mats is concrete okay it's not concrete but it's it's you know the sort of straw like stuff um i'll show that in another video sometime but it's it's basically they lay it on concrete um compared to my nice uh carpeted floors it was not fun to sit on your legs it sounds easier than it is for me mainly because i have really long legs um i'm a tall guy it was really awkward for me to be doing that but you know we got to experience cool little things they are very particular about how you ah take um you know the cups you have to turn it special ways i don't really remember it because i screwed up pretty much the entire time i did the the ceremony because i kept fidgeting and stuff trying to get comfortable um but yeah we got to get little japanese sweets i mean there's not a whole lot to really tell about about the ceremony in terms of specifics um there are definitely resources out there if you want to know exactly how it works it sort of varies too um one thing that's interesting is my teachers there were saying that japanese tea ceremonies really aren't so much about the rules as they seem but about doing these these little traditions to make everyone feel comfortable and to feel um part of this same group and you know it's really it's supposed to be about your conversations with each other and um you know just having a good time that's definitely the main point but uh yeah seiza sucks except for my friend paul the other guy that was there yeah yeah so he just sat there like there's nothing he's like yeah i sit like this every day ha ha man i looked like a retard when i was doing my culture classes one of the old guys that taught us he's supposedly like the oldest baseball player of all time he gave us a little little tip that you guys should try out because i tried it and i think it's true so we were talking about korea one day and he was saying that apparently you can tell the difference between a korean and a japanese woman based on their legs now this is because japanese women apparently apparently most japanese women have bowed legs meaning they kind of i can't really do it with my fingers but sort of something like that you know there's kind of a round gap here right well apparently korean women don't have this and the reason for that is because japanese women traditionally always sat seiza from like a really early age and korean women will sit like sideways like we went out there and uh it's very easy to spot because pretty much all the pants that women wear especially in japan japanese women are so skintight there's nothing left to the imagination so you can pretty much see the entirety of ah the leg structure of the woman so though i didn't get out my protractor to measure the exact angle that they were bowed i was pretty sure ah from then on out who was japanese and who was korean that's an interesting factoid taught to me by a very very old ah japanese man so anyways the ah following clip is showing me getting prepared to go in to the tea ceremony,,846

488,it's been a bit of a while um yeah i almost didn't film this because i looked at my face and said mary your eyebrows are out of control and you haven't put any makeup on for weeks why it's isn't true no it is true you might be able to hear a leaf blower outside i keep looking at myself it's been a while okay i'm gonna quickly do this before my computer goes way too hot hachoo hachoo hachoo these are computer noises oh you can see a man hi so i recorded this vlog and then my computer crashed yay technology i'm so happy about it ah so i decided just to do it all over again because i went off on this tangent about things that i realized i it isn't that i shouldn't be talking about them it's just like why am i talking about them why why why sorry i was just yeah anyhow so uh i've been busy working as i do if you follow me on twitter and you should then you you know read a lot of tweets about like sitting in the street and i'm painting shoes and i'm working on the website and i'm painting other stuff and bein artsy as i do it's my job or i just did the shop update or whatever whatever i do or you know things like i had to pee pee um yes my roots are back a month ago i got my hair dyed up again and i had my roots and uh my eyebrows look like quite insane so i'm just bringing back the eighties yeah shoes do do do do do i wanna give you guys music and i figured if i could just make my own music it should be finished today um anyways i should just make my own music with my mouth then they wouldn't take my video off the youtubes for copyright infringement speaking of copyright infringement this is hilarious and i realize now that i should've grabbed it earlier but i just thought about it about it um about three weeks ago i got maybe it was two weeks ago it had to be right about three three weeks ago i got a message from a friend of mine she said mary go to this livejournal shop there's something stuff of yours that i don't think you licensed and i was like what that's me like going there i was like boodaloodle uh so i boodaloodaloodled uh my computer is really heating up again hold on okay it just got brighter in here sorry for all the really bad cuts i just wanna get through this story um and then i'll tell you guys about the sale and i'll leave because i haven't really got much for an update and i look worse for wear so i went to the shop and saw that they were selling the shirt that did contain my artwork and uh was apparently bought at an australian shop so i contacted the people at the australian shop and they said they only bought five of these shirts uh at a shop stall in i think bangkok thailand so um it's from a company called happy hippie be cool t shirt suite so i bought the shirt from a person on uh livejournal and this is it and as you can see it is indeed my work but it's really bad you can just you can't make it out on here um but you can actually see all the pixels and it looks faded but it's just because the ink uh since it was blown up instead of having it blurred uh you know and all pixel y uh you can see through it to the actual shirt material and the ink is like every other pixel so yeah that's the worst quality i've ever seen but it made me laugh so there you go bootleg a mary tanner t shirts you can get them in bangkok it's messed up um aside from that fun i'm trying to think i don't know what else has been going on there's some videos that i wanted to put up having a lot of issues with my computer lately i don't like it i just got this thing in like december anyhow so i'm working on shoes um there's a huge shop sale and the link is over there and it's my etsy shop you buy two necklaces you get one free you buy two phone trams you get one free if you buy two art prints you get one free uh if you buy two rings you get one free and if you live in the us and you spend over thirty dollars you get free shipping and that's thirty dollars before the shipping charges are applied um aside from that in order to do it you have to actually go through um pay for it so you'd add like three necklaces and then i'll refund you the money for one of those necklaces because that's the only way i could work it out with paypal and with etsy so have fun there's tons of stuff in the shop i uh have been advertising everywhere i possibly can and i'm gonna go continue to paint i got a huge shipment of uh paint and clay and canvas and masonite boards and and i'm very excited to get started in with it but first i have to do other work and i have to uh you know go wax my eyebrows or something i don't know what do ladies do as if being a lady i like making stupid faces it's fun fun oh also i wanna have a live show eventually again i just don't know when and my biggest thing is i don't know uh how my computer can handle it uh uh yeah it really sucks i freed up a whole bunch of space so i can be faster it's not that i think i just need a different laptop cooler because this one is crap i have weird teeth my teeth are weird i'm gonna keep commenting about myself any disparaging remarks i say about myself it's not so you guys go no you're fine oh no no no we all look horrible equally it's fun i like to be self deprecating not cause i'm fishing for compliments i don't want the compliments it's okay okay i've missed you guys i've missed this i've missed this this it's something i've missed i've missed it

491,hey debris how you freaking doing eh i haven't a vlogged in a long time mostly i'm trying to entertain your asses with some kind of stupid stupid act but i thought you know what let me be real for one time well not for once because really me trying to entertain you but i see that it really doesn't have much effect you know even when i did the little and got over two hundred views no new subscribers so i you know whatever i'm just going to do what i do and we'll see what happens you know what i'm saying that's right mary posta's having a beer chilling out after a long day at work actually it's pretty late right now i'm going to be going to bed in a little while but i wanted to get that vlog out to a few people out there my public my adoring fans all fifteen of you yeah you know what something really cool freaking happened to me after i got home from work um i drive up uh behind my house and i'm walking up the stairs and i see this helicopter kinda like circling around you know and flying around and i thought wow that's a pretty cool looking helicopter and uh it was one of those jet copters you know and uh eh i didn't think much about it it was all really high up in the air and i go into my house and you know drop my keys and change into some shorts and a t shirt and you know get out of the office clothes and i put on the tv and i start watching some seinfeld and all of a sudden a really loud sound of the helicopter i can tell it's like overhead it's over the over excuse me over the house i'm like whoa that's pretty flying pretty low isn't it and so i kinda look out my front bay window in the front here and all of a sudden i can see that the leaves and the trees are rustling and all that and the wind is blowing everywhere and right in front of my house this helicopter is landing in the street right in front of my freaking house how many times in your life have you ever seen a helicopter land exactly in front of your house and i i see it's uh the broward county sheriff's uh department helicopter and it's funny you know it's not like i did anything you know i don't have a record i don't have any outstanding warrants but when i saw that i'm think i still had this feeling like they were coming for me like did i do something why the hell are they landing under my house you know then i'm like no no of course you know i blew that off real fast but it was funny that i had that initial reaction like oh shit you know they're coming for me and so this freaking helicopter lands in front of my house and i'm like what the hell are they doing and i see the like i walk up to the front of my window and i'm standing there with this confused look on my face and i see the pilot look over at me and then like you know finish like doing his landing and i'm like shit you know what's going on here and uh so uh doors open and this guy gets out from the side and he goes over to the back and opens up some doors in the back and he pulls out this like hospital gurney like what they have for ambulances and everything i'm like oh something must be going on like next door or in the neighborhood so i open the door and i come outside and i look around to the side and then i see a little bit further down a bunch of cars and an ambulance and all the stuff over there off to the side and i'm like uh okay maybe like there were less trees or something and you know like that was the best landing spot but then he took like you know the medical stuff over there to like where the paramedics were but yeah the whole neighborhood was out there watching what was going on apparently some somebody you know had some kind of medical issue i really don't know what it is you know um i saw the the firemen were directing everybody to get away from the area and instead of crowding around so i didn't want to be a jerk and go out there what is going on i gotta know we didn't do it who got hurt i gotta know everything i'm a nosy body you know yeah so i didn't want to be like that so you know i'm minding my own business you know somebody got hurt they're going to the hospital that's all i gotta to know right so they put some lady in the back it looked like a lady into the back of the helicopter the helicopter flew away and it had to be serious if they called in a helicopter so i said a little prayer for the person i hope they're doing okay and uh that was the big excitement when i got home today from work and occasionally i slip into my accent because like i got family from the south on my mama's side you know other times you'll hear me have a little street accent you know i did a little soul that's cause i grew up in chicago and then you know occasionally i like do a little you know thing you know my background in chicago you know but anyway so what was i talkn about oh yeah so the helicopter woo hoo yeah i know maybe it's not that an exciting story but how many of you could've claimed to have a helicopter land in front of your house huh you know another thing i wanted to talk about was anti american sentiment on youtube i saw this one video in a clip or at actually you know the comedian sacha baron cohen and he was in an interview with conan o'brien on the late night with conan o'brien show and he was doing the whole interview as the borat character and i didn't see the movie because honestly that kinda humor is a little over the top for me and i get i get seriously nervous when i watch somebody be that outlandish especially with people who don't know what's going on um and so i've been putting off watching the movie even though i'm sure it's going to be funny when i get around to seeing it but anyway the point is i saw this clip on tube of this interview and i put a quote in there a comment was which said i'm curious to know if any arabs find sacha baron cohen's characterization offensive because i but i saw borat doing the voice you know he's telling people he's from you know whatever country he's from i thought he was imitating an arabic guy um then somebody replies in the comment calling me you know you stupid american stupid fucking stupid american and you know borat is not arab um you know learn your fucking geography and you know but i don't blame you because you know you're an american and you know some all this anti american rage which just got thrown at me but the thing was maybe i'm wrong okay and the character is not supposed to be an arab okay whatever ethnic background he's supposed to be i thought he was imitating an arab and i thought you know what maybe you know some arabs wouldn't like this guy and would feel bad when they saw this saw them making fun of him i was trying to be nice say you know i'm curious do you find that offensive does that make you mad when you see that you know i'm trying to be racially sensitive to people out there or ethnically sensitive or whatever the hell it is i'm just trying to be you know uh sensitive to the feelings of other people out there my fellow brothers and sisters and then i get this kind of hatred this rage back for my trouble and this isn't the first time that i've encountered this kinda comments or seen those kinda comments on the internet and i gotta wonder you know why i've talked about this before in a previous video even though i erased the video before why is there so much hatred against america and americans from other countries you know uh a lot of times they claim that we're ignorant about their culture or the things that they're doing but i gotta tell ya i've talked to foreign through the internet and a lot of them know just about jack about the united states as well all they know about the united states is from what they see in movies and tv and you know as well as i do that most of that,,1552
492,good morning everybody it's sunday morning and my days on me that's what that is good afternoon we are driving to paris or actually it lecher near paris eh you guys know we're going to i juvelance christmas jam which is a specific beat a specific type of bmx freestyle it's um it's a rider a small freestyle bmx bike and the flat surface is like break dancing on a small bike you'll see it's just a bike i thought you said there's a bike in the back that's my camera bag and all the stuff this is food and drinks very important and eh this is my buddy's car he's driving of course this is his is his car and we've got two hours and twenty five minutes to go before we reach our destination and this is france we just crossed the border into france eh that means we've been through belgium and um we've been driving now for about how long we've been driving almost two hours almost two hours so eh the weather is great we got some sun and it's dry and so that makes good weather conditions for driving yup so i was just saying to my face that all though it's two hours away france is extremely different from the netherlands so is belgium by the way and it's very close to where we live i think the whole culture and the way the people live and listening to the navigation system and talking get to the wrong lane or something so uh yes completely different to the netherlands um especially the buildings and the way the infrastructure is but you know also the people itself could i live in france i don't know i could live everywhere i just you know adapt to my surroundings but i think i like the netherlands better how about you could you live in france je ne sais pas that's french for i don't know i will teach you guys french words so hello is um it's can bebon jour which is hello but i know i learned that only tourists say that but french people when they greet each other they say salut so yeah salut croissant croissant you know croissant guys yeah you know croissant anyway parapluie he he anyway we'll see we're driving on the highway uh maximum speed on the highway is the same as the netherlands i think a hundred and twenty kilometers per hour did i tell you i like this car is alo already over there and it was kinda disappointing that they didn't ride so much it was more like um you know just doing having some fun together and teaching or showing the little kids that you know are in juevelance's flatlands corps you know what flatland is and you know it was in a jam like a regular jam where they do like pretty hard tricks and links and stuff so it was too bad it was good to see and again and all the french riders and good you know to get back into the scene like this like a contest on a small scale so i'm going to go home now it's five o'clock hopefully we will be home at around eleven o'clock maybe we'll see where's our car so we are driving home and now its five o'clock and this computer says it will take four hours and fifteen minutes to get home so that'll actually means we'll get home uh early early early so uh um yeah we're rid we're driving to lecher this small town where the jam was and you know kinda disappointed that you know that you know it wasn't any hard core riding being done but you know it was good to see and and you know so they know you know i'm back in business and our little was wearing his hat and we're going home and stop you know stop somewhere to get a bite to eat right at the mac the mcdonald's of course yeah we're having fun yup we're going to get some dinner over here at the restaurant hopefully it will be good and edible which is not always the case here in france so we're waiting in line here it's not like but you know it's food so we were looking at the food over there and we were thinking like that's like that's like really gross so not going to do that probably get a sandwich or something hopefully maybe we'll see a mcdonald's on the way cause it's unbelievable we've been driving for almost like two hours or something an hour in a half no mcdonald's no one mcdonald's yeah one mcdonald's you know we saw that one when we were like passed when we passed it so pretty stupid so um yeah we'll probably get a sandwich or something cause the food over there is really gross and finally we found a mcdonald's yeah as you can see guys i'm back home again that's right and it was a long day and a timing day especially for who did all the driving four and hal four and a half hours to go there four and a half hours to come back i know you guys in us and canada are used to driving long stretches like this but for us in europe it's a really long drive anyway we had a lot of fun eh um i had a lot of fun had a lot of fun um yeah it just a cool thing to go on a road trip again me and we used to go like contest together um you know we would hang out for a weekend somewhere someplace some city and you know dinner and fun and stuff like that so that i'm glad that we uh did it again and hopefully we'll do it more often we're planning to do it more often so that's really cool um you want to see any flatland riding in this video guys um that's the way i'll i'll i'm going to do it with all the uh you know places i go to regarding bmx flatland um you'll see a small impression of the flatlands riding being done if you click on this link it'll go to my other channel my special projects channel and this channel will be just for you know the video di video diary the road trip in itself traveling you know me flogging so uh when it comes to like filming material for in my video magazine it was a uh a bad day it was a huge disappointment actually um because there wasn't any real hard core or flatland riding being done it was just more about um you know he has this place to himself it's like his trading spot and like he's giving back to the his community by he has flatland school where he teaches young kids so it was more about riders getting together you know for the kids you know doing some small you know stuff for the kids some some riding some relaxed riding for the kids there so it wasn't really like hard core riding that i want for my flatland video magazine so in ca in terms of uh filming material for was a bad day but in um when talking about um the first event for me to go on re launch to get back into the flatland scene again is it was a good day um i had the opportunity to talk to and in a relaxed atmosphere um we talked about and flatland in general and where it's going and you know so yeah everybody's enthu enthusiastic about getting back in flatland tv so that's good but anyway i'm going to leave you guys with a reinato quiz question for today which is my friend is not from the city helmond where i come from where i live in so what city is from okay so if you don't know the answer to that question you should check out thursday's video which is called an alien spaceship has landed and you'll find the answer in there i'm going to go to bed now and i'll see you guystomo,,1388
493,since our internet connection has once more decided to suck again today i thought i could just make a video instead of watching them okay the best thing that happened was that somebody i know or knew found my youtube channel that has happened before and well that's okay he wrote me a nice message and yeah the thing is that i last saw him about almost ten years ago and he wrote me a message and said that he didn't recognize me at first because i looked different well okay it's been ten years you never really notice that you change yourself the same week i found this channel project class reunion by sarah olzaga and she is planning to lose a certain amount of weight for her ten year class reunion so i'd also have my ten year class reunion this year i don't know if there's going to be anything and i don't know if i can attend because i don't live that close to my parents anymore but it got me thinking because ten years is a long time and people change and the question is when you just meet like about thirty or forty people what's the important thing is it what you achieved or what you are now like what am i i live in berlin i am an architect i work in a somewhat fancy architectural office i don't have children i'm not married but i live with my boyfriend for a few years would that be my profile would that be me and how much would it say about me or tell about the person i am so yeah that that just got me thinking who am i if i just meet someone i haven't seen for ten years it's just like what are you doing who are you now just could you answer that and would it just tell anything about the person you are not only facts like job kids married stuff oh another short thing there's going to be this youtube secret talent award show in ten days and that's going to be great because it's here in berlin and there are several people youtubers coming here and i'm really looking forward to that because it's kind of cool i hope so and yeah the watcho i don't know what to expect about that it's just the interesting thing is just to meet people and have fun together and yeah i'm really looking forward to that so i'll see you or you'll see me in person or video or something bye,,432
494,hi everyone um it's and this is um last week i did the um cooking video so that was week four i just didn't label it but anyways i'm glad like a lot of people liked that and um i got a couple of messages saying that they've tried it and stuff and that it was great and so that's that's awesome um i kind of have some bad news this week well today is thursday and it's my weighed in day and so i woke up went to the bathroom and stepped on the scale and i have gained one pound now i know it's just one pound but i was really hoping to lose like two but i guess in the big scheme of everything what's one pound compared to like fifty not not a lot i guess but still it's kind of disheartening but it it's motivated me because i do really well but like i do well during the day i do like perfect okay but then um at night i stay up really late and i need to not because i eat i get hungry it's horrible so i'll work on that because i don't want to waste time doing well during the day if i'm going to just ruin it all at night so i really need to work hard um yeah so this morning i decided to make a green smoothie which i make a lot okay but i didn't want to use milk just because i drink too much milk at night anyways so i had some carrot juice left over from some soup that i had made so i tried to put carrot juice in my shake um you know it just looks like that just normal anyways i'm going to try it because i don't really know if it will be good or bad or what um it's pretty good i mean it just tastes like it does with milk but like i guess you get kind of a carrot aftertaste um i think it's a great alternative and way less calories and uh lots of vitamin a so good to that so what went in to the blender was one banana a third of a cup of carrot juice three fourths cup of yoghurt or one like packet thingy like five ice cubes and a handful of spinach it's pretty good okay so i weigh myself a lot well not so much anymore but i used to i used to weigh myself like five times every day and if you think i'm kidding you i'm not um so i decided to do a little mathematical equation to figure out how much time that really is so what i did was i just pretended like i weighed myself once a day for my whole life okay eighty five years i'm gonna say is how long i'm gonna live um so if i weighed myself guessing that it would take one minute to do every day of my life for eighty five years i would waste five hundred and seventeen hours five hundred seventeen hours that's such a long time to be just weighing yourself um weighing yourself is such a petty thing to do anyways because i gained one pound this week but can i tell that i gained one pound this week no and if i had lost one pound could i tell probably not um what i should be doing is just measuring my waist once a month cause that is real progress a number on the scales isn't as important as it's not worth those five hundred and seventeen hours so i know that's a little unrealistic to weigh yourself everyday for years so i said okay i'll do this for thirty years alright if you weigh yourself once a day for thirty years you're wasting a hundred eighty two hours okay let's say you're doing it for just ten years you're dieting for just ten years and you're weighing yourself everyday that's sixty hours that's sixty days that you could be exercising for an hour a day and you could be losing real weight instead of weighing yourself all the time okay i weigh myself once a week now and it's really hard to stay off the scale because um last summer is when i really started wanting to lose weight and i didn't do it in a healthy way i restricted my calories and i didn't eat enough um i lost twenty pounds that summer so i wouldn't say i was like majorly restricting but it definitely was not good at all so then by that school year i'm like whoa i need to cool it you know i need to eat healthy again but i didn't still now i started to over eat because i really don't know why but i just i started to eat way too much so throughout the school year i gained this school year that's over now i gained like pounds back that's like now i have to loose that much just to get to where i was it's horrible it's a horrible thing to have to go through and so now i'm eating healthy and i'm loving it i'm a lot happier i'm getting my personality back um huh yeah and i'm just learning to love life again but i won't ever really be happy with what i weigh until i weigh until i get those forty pounds off cause i just wish i hadn't have done that because if i knew what i knew now i i could've lost so much weight healthy and i could have kept it off but you know i'm young i have a life ahead of me so i really don't have anything to worry about um yeah anyway sorry this was like end of a i don't know depressing video but i'm focusing on getting things better i get way too many thumbs up anyways um so comment subscribe i will talk to you all next week with a more positive message i'm determined and um goodbye,,1026

499,okay hey guys what's up this is i'm in the car i got the night vision on sorry about that but hey this is a message to my young high school listeners and even some of the kids that are just starting into college here is my advice to you about college i have a four year degree i went to the uc system i got a political science degree and here's my advice to you don't go to college college is utterly utterly worthless don't hurt your parents if you're begging off your parents sucking money off the teeth of your mom and dad to pay for your worthless schooling don't do it don't hurt your mom and dad they may not have a pension left after that number two get a skill that is in demand look around look at your mom look at your dad look what they do for a living look at your uncles look at your aunts see what they're doing to make a living and then go get that skill set most of the time you can get that without going to college just realize you're in a whole different environment right now if you go to college thinking you're going to get some bullshit english degree and you're gonna become a teacher or you're gonna become like some type of uh you know ba in business and you're going to get into middle management and make a hundred thousand dollars a year in your first two or three years this is your wakeup call this is i'm an adult talking to you unless you're gonna go and become like a doctor or you know maybe like a biochemist you know even biochemists are having trouble getting jobs you know don't think that you can just keep going to more and more schooling to get a job the economy is changing there may not be a job out there for you get a skill and first do your research okay i didn't do this i'm giving you advice okay do your research on what actually is paying money right now and then go to school and get that or better yet just go out and do the job go out and intern you know go work for free if you have to but get the skills necessary to make the money what i'm tired of is nineteen year old twenty one year old kids in calls as i talk to you and you guys sound like fuck i mean it's like i try to put reality into your face and you guys can't even accept it you're in some sort of la la land and you have no idea what's going on i've been there i've done that you've got to listen to me if you aim to be like an investment banker you better hope mom and dad have tons of connections unless you got a shitload of connections to get you into some business level corporate type of piss on job or whatever you're not going to get it through the normal progress college is over rated everybody has a degree i went for four years i didn't need to go to four years going to a little room with a bunch of dumb ass kids to listen to some professor that probably doesn't know what the fuck he is talking about isn't the way to learn anymore the way to learn now is to google it whatever you need to know you can type into google and spend twenty hours learning and teaching yourself or going out if it's a real skill going out and learn it yourself on the job go earn some money don't waste time in college think about what you can do that can go earn you money even if the pay is low you're going to get valuable valuable experience by just working on a job working on a job is way more working is ten times better than going to an artificial university setting and learning a bunch of stuff that doesn't apply to the real world so that's my advice to you get on the internet go out in the real world do real things realize when you paying ten twenty thirty forty thousand dollars a year for a university education that will be the last thing i have to say is if you're eighteen grow the fuck up just grow up you're not a little baby anymore you're a woman you're a man take responsibility for yourself and go out and work do anything i mean you don't even have to work just don't i mean go out and be a beatnik and travel the country you know hitchhiking you're going to learn more doing that then going to some little artificial university where someone's going to babysit you in some classroom just grow up okay your parents have ruined this county and they're babying the crap out of you it's time your generation stands up and says fuck you to college you know at college you don't need that you have the internet anything that you can be taught in college you can be taught via the internet so this is your wake up call george sotato to my younger listeners don't go to college it's a worthless investment and you won't have all the debt that you have to pay back take care peace out down with college up with learning and getting real world experience peace,,927
500,hello youtube i know i haven't made a video in a while and i keep meaning to but um i'm a procrastinator that's what i do um but this is kind of a response to community channel a couple of videos ago the one she made about um irrational fears and your secret escape plan because i've been thinking about this for a lot early way before she made the video and i pretty much know exactly what my escape plan would be but first let's talk about my fear i have an irrational fear of um people hiding in dark spaces at night in my room um which doesn't sound that irrational but pretty much every night i do the same thing i turn off all the lights in my room whatever and i'm about to go to bed except for that at night i check my email that's when i go on youtube watch videos whatever so all the lights in my room are off and then i just have my computer screen going and i stare at it for a while so everything around me is dark and then when i close my computer screen and put that away i still can't really see very well cause um the light has been so bright in my face so i can't see and then i normally curl up into the fetal position and start thinking about the fact that there's got to be people in my room somewhere hiding they're about to attack me normal places are there's a corner over there that um is dark and there's my closet which is back over there uh which is very small and dark and scary at night and i get to thinking that there have to be people in there and i'm always in the fetal position away from my closet looking in the other corner so i can't see those two places um and i just keep on telling myself there's no one there there can't be anyone there i've been there the whole time like i know the light was on in my face and someone could have snuck in because i couldn't see around me anyways but there's no one in there and i kind of just like put it at bay and start thinking about something else but then a couple of minutes later i'm freaked out again and i'm just thinking i've been lying in this one position like what if someone snuck in behind me and they're hiding in my closet and they're about to pop up and they're just like um and like attack me so my initial plan a long time ago was just kind of like if they came up from behind which was how it always in my head works i full bang them i like smack their face and then i scream as loud as possible because my parents are only a few rooms down and that was the whole plan but lately i've been thinking about it again and i have weapons now so the new plan is to smack in the face and scream and then rather like mend in their nose or whatever i did to them because i'm super strong in this dream yes can't you tell how strong i am um i reach down and i pick up the knitting needle because i always leave knitting needles near my bed now because i knit a lot this is not just like because of this fear i do knit a lot but heavy nails this is my favorite because it's metal and it's sharp and it's thin and i could just turn around and just stab somewhere like you said probably in the eye because that would be the most time consuming place and then i normally keep this over my door but i just got it so i can show you and then i got the newest part of the plan because i just got this not long ago from some of friends we were in china town and they bought me a samurai sword here i'll take off the sheath it's like actually sharp it's like a sharpened samurai sword so i get up while they're mending their eye which i just stabbed with a knitting needle ooh there we go um and i run for the sword and then i'm holding them there with the sword like what you going to do now i have a sword in your face bam yeah but that's my plan there's this sick little part of me though that really wants it to happen like as scary as that would be is it weird that there's part of me in myself that's like i want to try out my plan i want to um i'll make another video soon because i have other stuff to talk about other than how i'm going to kill an assassin who's hiding in my closet okay mwah bye,,839

502,hi it's this is i just want to check in and let y'all know about my vegan thanksgiving it was fantastic this year i celebrated with a group of people at a potluck a vegan potluck um it was a little bit different because in the past whenever i've done a vegan potluck it's been uh before thanksgiving day and then thanksgiving day i celebrate it with my family my family happens to be vegetarian and vegan so i've always had a vegetarian or vegan thanksgiving so it's not unusual for me to omit the turkey um and i don't i've never felt a need to substitute it but the last few years uh because of marriage and other circumstances there've been a few more omnivores in our family and um i felt compelled to provide alternative options for them and also it's just fun to experiment with faux meats so i did try a tofurkey one year and uh again this this year we had a tofurkey at our potluck and it's okay i think it's just fine i actually prefer uh tofurky brand products uh that are not the actual tofurkey i like their sausages and stuff like that but i don't really like their turkey substitute that they make for thanksgiving i prefer instead something called celebration roast that's made by a company called field roast so we had that at our table as well we also had a dish that was like a homemade seitan dish that um i don't even know who brought it but it was pretty good um and that worked as another one of our main dishes we had just a bunch of main dishes it was crazy um we also had lots of traditional foods we had yams and we had um pumpkin pie you know and all those kinds of things which it's very easy to make most of the traditional thanksgiving side dishes vegan or uh at the very least it's very easy to make them vegetarian but it's pretty easy to make them vegan just substitute stuff like margarine for butter or you use olive oil instead of butter um you know you can soy sour cream you can get vegan mayonnaise you can get vegan versions of a lot of um a lot of the products you might use in a lot of your side dishes or just try to do it just a little more healthfully and omit a lot of the fatty substances and make it just plain vegetables or just plain beans or something like that we had a speaking of beans we had a three bean stew that was really good i love that um that's something that my mom makes and and uh i really liked it so that was good um what else did we have we had um geez we had so many different things we had like five different desserts like i said we had three or four main dishes we had a whole bunch of sides i didn't even try everything and normally in a potluck that's the whole point right to try at least try everything take a spoon or a fork from every offering but um that just wasn't possible there was too much food way too much food it was really good to celebrate also with other vegans it's important to reconnect with our community and to know that we're not alone and you know share ideas and thoughts and experiences so that was nice to be part of thanksgiving and that i could give thanks to be part of this wonderful community of people who are so thoughtful and compassionate and um just good and joyous so uh anyway that was my thanksgiving i hope you had a fabulous thanksgiving and um take care bye,,641
503,hello youtube ah i was approached by one of my viewers on one of my uh videos uh or because of my videos to uh share her story and after reading her story i of course said i would and uh given that uh the comment on this video will be approval pending and the reason behind that is is i don't feel that there's any argument with it so i'm not going to allow any i mean if you can respectfully argue your point and if you disagree you know respectfully i may actually let those comments be approved but if i see basically what looks like trolling they're not going to be approved um the five star ratings will still be allowed but that will be the extent of it and as you know i have never done this to any of my videos so obviously i feel very strongly about this subject and i feel that arguing you know below the video would simply devalue the story in itself so i will get started um i also don't know how long this video will be because i am not going to chop any of this story up i will be reading as it was written to me i am i am prochoice and this is why here is my story when i was sixteen i had a baby aborting and adoption was no option for me my choice my parents raised me if you make a mistake own up to it and i did when my son was six months old three men came to my door asked for my ex brother in law at the time we had no screen door or a window to look out of to see who was there i told him that he wasn't there and they barged in and then two of them raped me cops where called evidence was collected i was not given any pills as they do today to rape victims all i got was dressing like that no wonder you're just asking for trouble i was wearing a tube shirt and shorts at the time because it was hot and i had the door and window shut when i go out in public i wear a t shirt and jeans and still do to this very day one month passed and my worst fear became a reality i was pregnant again abortion and adoption was no option my choice i went to my second doctor's visit and he told me that every thing was fine but it wasn't the man lied now child services got involved when more even more and said that i was immature and that my son would be better off without me so i ran with him and moved to any other city before they could get their hands on him i know it was wrong but what other option did i have stay there and they take my son or leave and hold on to him anyways living in a new city i though every thing would be better i got a job visited the doctor i thought everything was going great the second child was born two weeks passed after his birth and i new something was wrong with this child oh no everything is fine your just over reacting next visit everything wasn't so fine he stopped breathing he was rushed to a children's hospital finding out that he had a vessel from his heart wrapped around his wind pipe this could be corrected but there was more his body temperature was his body temperature was below normal his weight and he had ms leaving him blind and deaf here's the real kicker always leaving worst for last he had incurable brain cancer i knew that there was something wrong because this child never cried always gasping for air he never moved or anything he just laid there they explained that it was it wasn't my fault which i was grateful at least someone was on my side i was also told that according to my medical chart the doctor who took care of me knew all about it from the first visit i confronted him and asked why he lie why did he lie to me his reply he would have terminated the pregnancy you're absolutely right i would have that poor little boy suffered for eight and a half months i took him home where he later died this is why now i have become prochoice no one and i mean no one as the right to with hold information or to tell some one what they can and cannot do because of what they believe in prolife people only tell you one side of the story like someone who had an abortion and regretted it or someone who is raped and is happy they didn't do it they never tell the story of people like me if i knew then what i know now i would have gotten the abortion a child should never have to suffer that kind of pain parents should never have to sit and watch their child suffer knowing that they had other options and was denied that option why didn't i give him up for adoption now honestly would you take a child that you know is going to die or would you take one that was healthy besides i never really like adoptions and don't highly recommend but i would never tell anyone that they couldn't either that is totally up to them i had three sisters that were taken away from my parents just because my dad lost his job and had no money at the time child services did not give my father any time to look for a job for a new job before coming in and ripping his children from them no job no money no children my parents had no choice someone made that for them thank you for listening to my story i hope this helps someone in whatever decision they make in life i'm not going to comment any further but there is a question that needs to be asked and i'll let this ask it,,1043
504,okay so when you're pregnant basically your hormones like makes you go certifiably insane but they also make you do something else that's really kind of cool because they make your hair and nails grow and your skin glow and everything looks great and then after you have the baby your hormones like go crazy again and basically what happens is um your hair starts falling out because your hair doesn't really fall out when you're pregnant so it just kind of all falls out at once and well i was vacuuming the other day and i wondering why the vacuum wasn't really working very well and i tipped it over and you will not believe this but this is what i cut out of the bottom of the vacuum now you can see that this like matches my hair right this is disgusting i like shed more than a pet um and yeah this is other like carpet and fiber in here does not come off my head by the way so um yeah this is really gross i'm even showing you guys this but this i had to cut all of this hair out from from the bottom of the vacuum this is like enough to make a wig for a small child she's just like mummy she loves wigs see she likes it i'm a little baby with the wig boop boop,,235

508,you know what i think it is entirely reasonable for me to place the blame for my behavior tonight on mee maw and pa paw i just i don't think that they gave me enough attention i don't think that i've had enough attention as a child you know you know support from them as a child and now i act out as a way of getting attention of gaining some kind of parental approval you know i just want people to love me you know i mean isn't that what we all want we just want people to love us and that's really like i just want people to love me i wish i had a a bigger upper lip like my mom i think it's fine i just i wish i had a yeah mmm i need a song oh my god that's like a fucking i had an austin bright in my head like when i'm taking pictures and stuff like that like i can't stay still like if i'm waking for the camera to click off i'm like i don't if that's a human person or if it's just some like alien person i really do believe that i'm a alien or a robot or something one of them because like you people i i haven't quite fully learned how to integrate you know human cultural cues into my system into my program and you know it's like a foreign language to me that i'm still learning i haven't fully integrated ever since i was dropped here you know actually i think that i fell from like a shooting star like flying across the universe or something like that and like i fell and somehow i landed on your fucking planet and like i just happened to land in a woman's womb and just popped out like nine months later and like i'm a fucking alien so we are not the same has anyone stopped to think about just how weird you are as a person like if you if you don't think that you're weird then that's whack you you're pretty whack and i don't wanna be your friend because i like weird people everybody has their quirks that makes them so weird like people are just weird like i don't know if i'm the only one that knows it that people are just weird i think it's because i notice how weird i am it probably cues me in how weird other people are i think that's how it works sometimes i'm i'm watching my back what're you doing here i better stop saying that a lot of people have been sending me messages on since i've been gone yes i have been absent and um youtube is not my life you know i just have other things to do so um get off my austin nuts all right shit i'll post a video when i want to damn that is so rude but whatever this is my show okay all has been paid for and it's mine oh yeah and this woman she was like she was really an older woman and she was hitting on me and she was like you know you come off a little bit gay in your videos i don't know if you intend to or not and i was like well i am gay yeah i'm gay me and the peen we have an um long standing relationship we have a contract you know every now and then i had to spit excuse me it wasn't really spit i had just ate some you know those little pizza roll things that you pop in the microwave and then like a minute or two minutes later it pops out fifteen delicious bites of pizza delicious ness you know what i'm saying i just had one of those i had one with uh meat like meat not the kind of meat that i would like to be fucking there but you know what that was inappropriate so first of all i am crazy so if you think i'm crazy then it's true i am crazy but crazy in a good way like crazy in a you know i need to be crazy to free myself because i'm a very reserved person like i don't know if you now noticed it but i'm a very reserved person i am and i hate that it's like i have this inner urge to be so exuberating gregarious and outgoing but then i get in those you know in an alien situation where i'm around human beings and it's like i don't understand what people are saying it's like i haven't i don't know i just i'm a on my head at one point and now i can no longer understand how to be a participant in human in society and so i observe so i can learn how to fully integrate myself into society and i don't remember what my original point was because i just start rambling about you know being a freaking alien in human society because i've always felt sometimes you know i'm trying to see how long this video is because i'm really not trying to make a long video i just want to like babble and put something on the youtube just to be like yo i'm still here i'm working very hard um well that's a fucking lie i'm working um i try to write everyday i do and i've had some major setbacks even though i've had some brilliant revelations um and i'm working on something right now that's put together brilliantly it is like all of the plans that i have for all of the books that i wanted to write are coming together into one book and it is amazing it is amazing and um i hope that people will love it when they get it when i finally you know happen to get it into the hands of an agent and an agent gets it into the hands of a publisher and then the publisher to an editor and then the editor actually has it published i'm i'm i know it's gonna be amazing i know it will and i just i'm looking forward for the day when i can walk into a bookstore and see my name on the book on the shelf the shelf and then i'll go on oprah or ellen you know and the whole audience will get free shit damn but yeah i don't know what i'm talking about i don't know why i do this i don't know why i do this it's like late at night when i couldn't well i can't cook right now i'm currently in my brother's room okay sh don't tell nobody but i'm broke i can't really do anything and it's really heartbreaking when you really want to be out there and but you just don't have the money it it breaks my heart to be in the house i don't like to be in the house like i used to be such a homebody ask people who know me like a year or two ago and i was such a homebody it wasn't like i didn't even want to go out to party but like i was just like well you know we can but now it's just like yeah let's

509,my parents like to constantly remind me that when i grow up i have to marry and asian wife which is okay i like asian women but i don't like narrowing my options girls are like a bag of m and m's you know different colors on the outside but on the inside they're all the same and they all taste good hmm hmm no one opens a bag of m and m's and goes hey i'm only eating the yellow ones you know why cause that's racist hey blue m and m i don't like your skin tone or your culture or your lifestyle so i'm not eating you i only eat yellows but like most parents i think the main reason my parents want me to marry an asian lady is so that we can only have little asian babies which i don't agree with the world needs more interracial babies i think the only way we can stop racism is to have more interracial babies you can't be racist to a mixed person it's too hard i've tried well you're just mad cause you're ah you're ah ah what the hell are you no but my parents really do want me to have asian babies i can't even joke around with them i've tried messing around with my dad but he takes it very seriously okay so he's sleeping right now but i'm gonna to wake him up anyways hey dad wake up wake up i have really bad news i got a girl pregnant um it's with a black girl what i want to change topics cause i wanna talk about my dad for a bit cause he's very gullible so the other day i got this phone it's called a junebow a junebow it's not your regular phone it looks like a real cell phone but all this thing does is it shocks you when you press this middle button right here and i'm not gonna lie it kinda hurts so i wanted to record someone's reaction and i thought to myself who could i use this on and it'd be absolutely hilarious and i was like my dad definitely i love my dad but that's what he gets for not letting me have interracial babies so guys and girls let's start treating each other like eminem and that's all i have to say for now thanks for watching mmm mmm mmm these rolls are so yummy just say you love me no why you do that it was an it was an accident,,429
510,thought you'd never get to see this face again have you well things haven't been that bad and things haven't been that good either mm the bad part is that i have been homeless the good part is that i got permanent housing but i might have permanent housing again but in the place that i should of been in and shouldn't of been homeless but things are looking up in one way but still haven't gone the way they should have gone and because of the economy and things are changing but you know what's going on out there just as well as i do so this is just a first of some of the videos that i can put out right now um because i got some of my stuff so i can post this too you i still got the same old set up cause money's been tight just like i know you have not had the money but been getting some new people subscribing so here is the first of a couple of videos i'm going to do this week and i'm going to rant and rave uh just fluff just like i used to and just go woah just like i looked good then i still look good but the medication has changed somewhat for the better but not good enough for me so as far as work they still haven't written anything consisive sic and i am still waiting on social security cause right now they are just testing testing testing and i can't change doctors cause i don't have the money and hopefully congress can do something i can't ask for obama to do more that he's put out in a radio address because it's not his it's his final decision but it is still up to congress and it's been their decision for the last ten years and they've just been sitting with their thumb up their butt waiting on the insurance companies and it's been their decision to tell us what to do when we're being giving them money and they've been going to the bank every day with our money and the only thing that we can do is just sit there and take it and we shouldn't be taking it same with the doctors if we don't like the way the medication feels don't take it sometimes you do have to live with the pain and i've been trying to do that for about the last two and a-half almost three years so you're going to get here more bitching about pain and how i feel so that's the way it's going to be for me for a bit but other than that this is the first of a few videos just to tell you that i'm still here so peace,,472
511,hello everyone it is wednesday december second and this is your five video hope all of you had a really good thanksgiving um i didn't see any recent videos so i'm assuming it was good but i know mine was awesome i'm sorry i didn't post last week it's just wednesday was my travel day and i was pretty much gone from eight in the morning until i landed at minneapolis at seven at night so i mean it was a long day of planes and trains automobiles but other than that my break was great i got to see all of my friends and hung out with my family and um i saved one hundred and twenty dollars on the first four seasons of house so i mean black friday well spent in my opinion but uh it went really fast and although it was really good to be home it was definitely kind of just like oh it was like you know like the carrot dangling in front of me but i'll be back in less than three weeks anyway i think i fly home on the nineteenth or whatever so now it's kind of just the final push through finals half final push uh but um yeah i don't know it's going to be good i have let's see well i have a paper for my two level class and i have a paper for my brit lit class and i have a latin final final but that should be fine and then i have a portfolio to finish for my writing class and so it's just going to be a lot of writing and i like that but at the same time i'm kinda just like aww we have beatles rock band in the house now and that's what i'd rather be doing actually we're doing that tonight we're having a beatles rock band party so you know i'm being productive but i don't know it's just it's my favorite time of year and i'm in an ugly sweater today in honor of december second and its chilliness and the fact that it's december and i really want a candy cane um yeah but i i don't know i just am like like basically the last three months of the year are when i'm in my element like i just love them and it's the best so i'm really excited and i'm excited to be home and i'm excited to go to england and just i'm really excited i don't think i told you guys but a few weeks ago hank green came to seattle and i flipped out and was so excited to go until i realized that his like cd signing thing was the same night as my roommate's musical theater performance which i had promised months before to go to so once again i did not get to meet the greens my friend ari was nice enough to get a cd signed for me so now i have a little hank green cd with an anglofish on it and my name and it's one of my prized possessions and so hopefully in the near future i'll actually get to meet them for real i've been like knitting this scarf for my boyfriend for a while but it doesn't really seem to be getting anywhere and i just want to finish this ball of yarn like before the holidays begin so i'm just i don't i don't know i have no idea what to do and i have no money and i'm just like blah but um once once december eighteenth is over my life will be awesome so you know sixteen more days of hell yeah i hope all is well i have to go tutor now but i will see you guys next week,,642
512,ladies and gentleman robots this blog is lastly in response to an article posted on facebook com about a toddler sized robot that has learning capabilities that within two years will be similar to that of a two year old child the link is in the sidebar this robot was designed to learn just like a human it looks like a human kinda it talks like a human kinda and apparently it can even walk like a human a quote from the article which the company that built the robot might consider as promotional material is it's not human but it is paying attention or maybe not this article doesn't just deal with this creepy two year old robochild folk it also talks about the use of robots in modern society a few of the uses that it cites for robots are a talking office receptionist a security guard a primary school teacher these are all examples of robots that have actually been built and used a primary school teacher really there are robots that can strut catwalks and assist elderly people who are living alone now the first thing i have to ask in a global recession when there are so many more jobs needed than have been in recent history do we really want to be thinking about replacing human workforce with cold mechanical machines the article does close with a paragraph that might explain my reaction to it the transfiguring metallic assassins from the future aside there's something that unnerves me about an old man alone in a house with something that runs on batteries,,268
513,hey guys this is coming to you from the channel on youtube now today i just wanted to discuss with you the three main operating systems that people use okay the main reason i'm doing this video is to try to use sony vegas which i barely got it's pretty confusing but so are girls so whatever but yeah so i basically asked people what their favorite operating system was and i got a quite a few responses on twitter but i chose three that popped out to me and that is from yadda yadda he says i'm a pc that wishes i'm a mac lags way too much but that may be a ram problem yeah i've heard a lot about um i can tell i can tell you from personal experience that vista takes up a lot of ram i mean they say that it needs minimum two gigabytes of ram to operate but it really takes up like three to four which sucks um and the person that sent me a response was nixypic i thought that was a pretty funny response so that's why i included that and um jimmy tryon on twitter writes um that he uses windows and linux i use mac for doing video and audio production and you know we've seen in recent years that macs have pretty much become the standard for video and audio production so now i'm posing the question to you the viewer what do you like to use personally windows macs maybe linux tell me,,258
514,hey everybody so before you immediately decide to write a hater comment and tell me how much i suck listen to me because i do have an actual point it's not just cause i listen to her and i don't like her i don't hate taylor swift as a person um i think she's pretty i think she should be a model uh she's tall and she's thin and she's gorgeous um she seems like a nice person i just really dislike her songs a lot and let me tell you why cause it's actually pretty funny i don't know how many people have noticed this but a lot of people who are kind of into music i guess or have a keen ear doesn't even you don't even have to be into music can notice that people use the same pord pord progression chord progression in every song and chord progressions are basically um the order in which you do the chords you know c d f minor i don't know name any four um most notably a band it's like this is nickelback you know if you listen to their songs closely it's just dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun in every song basically the way the chords go anyway so to prove a point to my best friend maria who is absolutely obsessed with taylor swift um i transposed all of taylor swift's songs into the key of c which basically means i've got all of her songs all the chords i put them so they sound they're in the same range basically and although the chords are different in the songs when you put them in the same key they are literally all the same literally basically almost the same they use the same four chords in every song this is taylor swift i'm talking about they use c g a minor and f in every song if you put it in the same key and to prove to you how similar they are i'm just going to play all of her songs in succession so people can see what i'm talking about cause i'm not just stupid when i say that all of her songs sound the same and not only musically do they sound the same lyrically they are all about guys they re all about guys i'm a teenager with raging hormones i'm a girl i like cute romantic movies okay i whatever fairytales sleeping beau i don't care okay i am not this boy crazy just throwing it out there this is c this is g a minor and f romeo take me somewhere we can be alone i'll be waiting all we have to do is run you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess it's a love story baby just say yes it's kind of off but that's how the song goes basically i might get some of them wrong i apologize here's a reason for the tear drops on my guitar the only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star here's the songs that i sing and i don't know why i do that's basically her two most popular songs right there at least i know them but there's more if you can see that i'm the one that understands you been here all along so why can't you see you belong with me you belong with me so yeah cause i can't i can't help it if you look like an angel i can't help it if i want to kiss you in the rain so come feel this magic i been feeling since i met you can't help it if there is no one else and that's how the song goes that's hey stephen the same four chords now i'm going to use the same four chords but it's going to be in a slightly different progression it's going to be c a minor f d and when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song the one we dance to all night long and the moon like a spotlight on the lake and when you think happiness hope you think of my little black black dress think of my head on your chest and this faded blue jeans i think it goes that way there's no tune and it goes exactly in this progression i just wanted to slam your screen door sneaking out late tapping on your window when you're on the phone and you talk real slow cause it's late and your mama don't know i'm not finishing that because it would have required me to write down the lyrics and i didn't really feel like writing them so one more i hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive you're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying so watch me strike a match on all my wasted time as far as i'm concerned you're just another picture to burn and that's what's up and that's why i hate taylor swift's songs,,850
515,hello um i'm learning guitar and this is a song that i love that i decided to try to cover so it's called company by an horse and sorry about the lighting i don't know so please put on that record again and i will put on that shirt you've been wearing around you've been wearing around it's times like this i think too much times like this i think too much oh please don't think too much cause i can't let you in cause these walls have been built no i can't let you in cause these walls have been built but you said i'm out on a ledge come stand with me i need the company i need the company my face has turned red but it's not from something you just said no i'm blushing on inside it's those damned green eyes and panel by panel and piece by piece this all fits together but it's not what you think there i go again there i go again you said i'm out on a ledge come stand with me i need the company i need the company i'm trying to get you in i'm trying to get you over and i'm trying to get you in i'm trying to get you over and i'm trying to be brave i'm trying to be brave i'm trying to be brave i'm trying to be brave come with me to every word and i'm saying i'm trying not to give it away i like to keep my cards so close keep that cunt so long and all my broken heart and all my forgettable false starts well you can come right now but you'd better not look away you can have em right now but you better not look away this is me trying to be brave you can have em right now you better not look away this is me trying to be brave,,325
516,this is a response to um okay so the first question would you kill a butterfly for a week's paid vacation no i wouldn't be able to do it i just wouldn't be able to do it i don't know like stepping on a butterfly i might but i couldn't like take a butterfly and like pull its wings off like that's just sadistic and not right i wouldn't be able to do it even for a month's vacation i wouldn't be able to do it um would you add one year of your life for taking someone else's no i wouldn't be able to do that either because you know like i don't want to die but i don't want to be responsible for someone else dying too you know like taking years off another life so i can live another year what's good about me that makes me like able to take someone else's and be okay with it i wouldn't be able to do it so that's a no would you urinate with someone else i've done it before um i'm a girl so we go to the bathroom in groups so yes i could do it whatever right so long as they don't make any comments about hearing it so easily but yeah i'm okay with it it's fine whatever right are you going to ask me i'm very good about that actually i enjoy getting coupled because i don't like doing things on my own like cooking i'll do on my own but i like having someone there you know you can talk to and later on you can go or whatever you know i don't like working by myself because it gets very lonely you know when there are lots of people answering it gets very lonely because you know you can't really talk to your customers about like other things and you're not really friends with them so it gets very lonely uh if there was a public execution would you watch no i really wouldn't i don't want to watch someone die i don't care i don't care how bad they were i don't care who would want to watch okay yeah someone's getting executed you know i don't want to watch somebody die i don't watch the simpsons but i'd rather watch the simpsons than watch an execution um so i apologize for the dark circles i'm logging off i'm extremely tired,,411
517,it's really difficult doing this particular part of a blog where i am trying to talk about the economic crisis and me and um my story i have recorded this a number of times um i stumble over myself and so here we go again um you know when it comes to the economy and me and my story you know i don't think mine is really a whole lot different than millions of other people because really and truly this current economic crisis which you know we kind of recognize began um two thousand and seven um started for many of us though really about ten years ago with the tech telecom crash um so in my case it actually was the year two thousand when i lost a twenty eight year career um and it was without any buyouts uh pension any benefits or anything like that it was just uh cause not everyone got all of those kinds of things which i think is a huge misunderstanding across this country that uh you know there is a huge sort of have and have not of a group of people when they do uh leave companies so uh i managed to sort of kind of gather myself together and regroup from then and it was you know it was not uh totally unexpected and i continued on but the thing was that you know what uh that didn't didn't that didn't do to me um was changed on september eleventh two thousand and one when uh that event affected my partner uh financially so there was kind of a double wammy there and we were still doing quite well i cannot say that uh things were bad for us uh we definitely had taken some financial hits on you know retirements and things like that so we quickly knew and had to start changing our thinking on the way that we lived and how that we spent money and uh neither one of us really have ever been uh in debt or uh use debt much um so um cost cutting things like that which in a lot of ways honestly was inherently in our nature um it just seemed kind of crazy though because uh we were working as hard as we ever were um in fact even more so and uh we were making you know decent money not great money and i know that uh we knew that people that were around us were making about the same money but somehow they seemed to be doing so much better with a lot of the material consumer goods and all that kind of stuff and uh and so that was a very interesting awakening uh in the consciousness about you know how americans are and how we have become the country consumers and you know we just begin to learn to live sort of with that and not be a part of it i suppose um however that doesn't mean that this last economic crisis uh in two thousand and seven didn't impact us uh me in particular particularly hard because um i've been lost uh the second uh job that i had uh had for a long time and um you know it's been difficult uh more but we were fairly well prepared for all of that stuff and have been holding our own keeping our head above water and um that's still the way it is now but this cannot go on so it really is all about um continuing to look for those multiple streams of income that you know are small but you know they do contribute to things um and um looking at the whole way of uh employment and income and jobs entirely differently um and approaching it from a whole different way in so that in order to be able to accept that there is a new world this is a new way of doing things it's not going back to the way they were even if there is a recession technically called over the rebuilding period is going to be a very different thing for so many of us um and it is really about how we adapt to that and it's fluid it's ever evolving it's constantly changing and that's the key thing is knowing that it's shifting ground and that we are operating on shifting ground and if we can keep that in mind and still keep our heads together we've got at least some chance,,760

519,guess who's procrastinating i am there's a really loud airplane i kind of haven't been here i'm sorry about that i've had exams last week and i have another another one this week and the which is a three hour exam for i don't know why and i think it's a total waste of time but we'll see how that goes and if you've got exams as well good luck hope you're doing well um i don't know why i point over my shoulder when i say last week and this week anyway um and after this video i probably won't be here for the next month because i have my final killer exam ever and i've kind of been neglecting piano because of school exams and i kind of burnt my hand yesterday because um i was serving soup i'll explain this later i was serving soup and my dad walked into me and then the soup fell and i just like dropped the bowl and ran off and stuck it under cold water but my dad called me weak for the next two hours just because he refused to admit that it was his fault so then he's was like shhhh you can't handle pain i was like yeah it was your fault god um but yes i was serving soup because my grandma's cousin's son and daughter are here um i think they're my second cousins once removed because they're my dad's generation um so if somebody understands family trees would they care to explain to me who they are to me because they they are related to me you know if you're asian i mean everybody's related to you sorry to butt in i found out after they left that they're actually my grandma's cousins not my grandma's cousin's kids they're just the same age as my dad my dad calls them uncle and auntie i've been calling them great uncle and auntie the entire time it's just i didn't know because my mom sort of tells me to say whatever in a foreign language i could have been calling them streetlamp i wouldn't know um i actually called their kids uncle and auntie and their kids are like twelve or something so well i guess if you want to get technical they're not they're my cousins okay not going to get technical but the good thing about when people come over they give you gifts i got a hundred bucks and a really expensive necklace and trust me to be you know more in love with the packaging because how cool is this two colors i think it's cool with the ribbons and the thing yeah i usually disregard the gift and go for the wrappings so yep um and because i have just been procrastinating for the past like three hours um i picked up this mascara because my mom always buys she always orders stuff and it comes with free gift things and she just gives them all to me i was reading this and it goes in case of an eye irritation discontinue use and see your ophthalmologist at once because everybody has an ophthalmologist you know they assume that people who buy high class stuff have ophthalmologists i assume that's some kind of eye doctor but really why don't go see a doctor it's not like you can get into a specialist person without a doctor referral anyway yes and other than that i think i should go back to studying and i think i have to catch the bus pretty soon anyway um cause my parents have left me at home and taken out my my second cousin once removed to red hill the winery and then they were going to go eat dinner at night time sorry did i say eat dinner at night time i think i meant eat dinner in the morning because when else do you eat dinner because you know if you're asian you go eat dinner when people come over it's me again the less cool version of me in a grey jumper she's also quite uncool okay i was saying i burnt myself on soup the next day i burnt myself on coffee because i was out i went to gloria jean's and bought myself a small caramel latte four dollars and five cents definitely didn't put the lid on properly um because the coffee ended up everywhere except for where it should have ended up in my tummy um i was in public so i tried to run away as inconspicuously and quickly as i could but it didn't go down so well because it was on the floor it was all over me um and i burnt my thumb and then today don't don't ever try and staple about a hundred pages together at once it doesn't work um i cause we're allowed to bring in notes for our exams and i had to staple this together i stapled them into three chunks and then i stapled the chunks together and it looked a bit you know like this it's quite graceful looking um and then i was trying to do that thing where you try and get as many papers together as possible without snapping a staple and that was the result um and i guess before the exam i was holding it like this with my finger over it and i guess i decided to move really fast and then i ripped a hole in my finger so yeah just don't try and staple things especially if you're me um which none of you are so that's my list of injuries for this week i will see how many times i run my finger through a staple in the rest of my life i'll keep you updated,,978
520,hi what's up um today i went to school and um um i was late for my first class because um it was really hard for me to get up cause it's a friday thank god it's friday um i didn't have um business mathematics class because there was a party going on a christmas party thingy going on at school and then i attended my six to nine class but it was only for an hour and i was so psyched because um um so everyone were passing their um term paper and i've already passed mine two weeks ago but i was lacking footnotes and research i i mean and references but um like he didn't return it he didn't return mine and so after he discussed um how to make term papers and he ended the class i went to him and asked if i could get it and stuff and he's an ambassador so it was pretty like um scary to ask and he was really like terror ish so but uh it was really cool that he knows me he called me by my name and he said that i should just do good in my final exams and that um my uh term paper was okay and that's really awesome so yeah um yeah that really psyched me and i'm really happy about that after that i went to um i went to um a bazaar in in the city in yeah in the city with with my best friend and and his mom so it's pretty cool anyway i got to shower and head to bed because um my friend's celebrating her eighteenth debut i mean her eighteenth birthday her debut tomorrow so yeah later bye,,293

523,what's the one thing you can't go a day without okay you have food and water and breathing so those are a given ron you know what i'm talking about right ninety eight percent of you i'm really just making that statistic up but i'm venturing a guess that it's pretty close to being right ninety eight percent of you can't go a day without listening to music and most of that music that you listen to wouldn't be there if there wasn't someone to teach it that's why this year for the project for austin i'm going to talk to you guys about vh save the music program music programs are something that are really close to my heart and it's something that i spend a lot of time with i was in concert bands for seven years throughout um junior high and high school marching band all four years of high school color guard and winter guard all throughout high school and i've danced basically since i could walk so for the last seventeen years every single one of those activities involved some kind of music whether it's playing it learning new music learning a new instrument listening to it choreographing routines to it whatever it invov it involves some kind of music and that music wouldn't be there if there wasn't a program for someone to teach when i graduated from high school in two thousand and six our band program consisted of almost two hundred fifty members and our choir program was equal in size high school now has two high schools and the music programs at both high schools consist of about one hundred students each it's not so much the interest in the programs are dropping it's the fact that there aren't funds to make these programs possible any more the vh one save the music foundation provides grants of new musical instruments to public elementary and middle schools that don't currently have any instrumental music program in place most of these schools don't have a program already in place because there's just not the funds to teach it the school district doesn't have the funds to buy the instruments or to hire the directors or to buy music it may not seem like it but if you walk into any high school band room the equipment and the instruments that are in that room are probably equal to a value of the school itself even if your school district doesn't qualify for a grant from the save the music foundation there are a ton of things you can do to keep programs running the next time your local band or choir comes knocking on your door for a can or bottle drive see what you have give it to them chances are you're just going to throw it out anyways okay so it is the middle of december and it's not really football season any more but next fall any friday night football game take a second watch the band perform at halftime even just watching shows support does your town have some kind of local fall festival winter festival anything like that chances are there is a band or choir performing at it check em out see what they have to offer most music programs put on about five or six concerts a year in addition to performing at football games parades graduation ceremonies and things like that even if you can't afford to help out the programs financially just by showing up is some kind of support a lot of programs will do a bottle drive or a canned food drive at the concert itself in the place of an admission fee it's a great way to donate and a great way to stay involved with whatever is going on so next time you're dancing around your room to your favorite song on the radio and you know which one i'm talking about take a second and think about how your life would be if you didn't have that music if there hadn't been anyone to teach that music i'm going to post a link in the sidebar to the vh one save the music program website and also to another great video at one of my uh favorite bands put out this morning the oceanic six they also did the save the music program and you can check out their latest single which is at the end of their video as well and i'm going to try to post this as a video response to that and see what happens so links in the sidebar go check it out support your local music program it's a great thing,,788
524,hello everyone as you can see it's not thursday but i don't care if i own half of this channel i believe that you know i can do what ever i want we don't have any rules anyway the actually reason that i didn't persevere this tuesday was because well one posted on monday and it just seemed weird to post on tuesday and two i was absolutely shattered why you might ask well let's go into that now see you all had a four day weekend in england well or crawley to be exact that is just half and hour by train south of london and it was very good and i have been vlogging about it on my personal channel oh that reminds me i should really post the last post of that i should really get on that so it's been an eventful week after the whole karate thing on monday we went into london and we went to the british museum for this exhibition and it was really good we went around london and saw all the sights and stuff kind of got a visit and i got loads of photos and stuff which will probably be going on my last video on my personal channel and then on tuesday we had like half a day cause we had to like get to the airport then so we went into crawley into the actual town and we went into hmv and got some dvds one of which was this dark than black volumes one and two which is episodes one to ten very good series i really do recommend it and then as i said after we got back i was shattered and then i was back to school on wednesday the entire day of which we went on this careers exhibition at rotterdam park hotel in quark it's this thing where loads of colleges and universities from the uk and ireland are represented and i got plenty of literature such as this cit prospectus and you know it was very informative very interesting and it wasted the day and on thursday it was back to proper school and that was real culture shock and then it was today and i am now reading this book the star that's written by h g wells it was written in like the thirties or something but it is very good i would recommend this as well and over the weekend i have to do an art essay and i've opted to do this film for it so that should be fun i think that is everything ah luke i will see you whenever what was that i don't know what was i going for there on to the music section,,462

526,all right so i'm a total liar and i don't blame you if you unsubscribe but huh if you're not going to keep watching my videos for me at least keep watching them for him what do you think about that song i've been here for thirty something years looking at myself in the same dirty mirror isn't it always kind of weird when you get like randomly called by someone and then they leave a voice mail i'm kinda scared to hear it cause that was somebody i met at a coffee shop like a month ago and i got their number and they are just like calling me and it's really weird cause it's like three in the afternoon who calls someone they met met at a coffee shop at three in the afternoon like a month after they met you i don't know maybe i'm just being weird i don't think i think they're really cool it's just kind of strange like i bet it's like one of those calls like hi i found this number in my phone and i was wondering who it is this is jamie you met me at a coffee shop remember i'm really awesome we'll see we'll listen to the message maybe i'll listen to it and then i'll let you listen to it but probably not so my tattoo yes i still have it imagine that all right so i think in my last video i said it was a milk thistle um i said that it was a scottish flower but actually it doesn't grow in scotland it grows in middle eastern regions um just to clear that up but people of scottish heritage do get it as a as a tattoo um it's usually more of a stylized version it looks more like a symbol rather than the actual plant um whereas i went for a more detailed look but anyways now down to spiritual meaning so the milk thistle plant has been regarded for centuries and centuries as a very highly powerful medicine um in terms of um it has been used for detoxification of the liver and also it's known for its anti cancer effects which are two pretty awesome things um you can actually buy milk thistle extract at wild oats silence and the reason why those two attributes of the plant really spoke to me and i thought it be a good thing to perm permanently adorn my body with is because one alcohol alcoholism is something that really affects my family um my aunt is in her sixties and right now she's suffering majorly from the long terms effects long term effects of alcohol um i personally have had issues with alcohol i started drinking when i was um i i was kind of a crazy kid for a while and so i wanted to put this thing permanently on my body um have it be the thorn on my the thorn in my side god i can't talk today the thorn in my side to constantly remind me never to put my body in jeopardy for mental comfort because i'm a firm believer that anything that's going to put your physical health in jeopardy isn't going to bring you mental comfort in the long run um i think that mind body and soul spirit they will they should be able to be happy all in the same context and in harmony with each other and so you need to keep finding that perfect balance between mental happiness and physical happiness before you are going to be truly happy so i have a thorn in my side to always remind me of that um and i don't mean not to drink i do enjoy you know well actually i don't cause i'm only twenty so it's illegal anyways and then the anti cancer effects um that's pertaining to my grandmother she is a breast cancer survivor she had her right breast removed and so my tattoo's on my right side pretty simple um but definitely a deep meaning and i'm guessing you want to see it again because the last video i did was pretty shitty it was pretty dark and i was all giddy and i just wanted to really quickly show it to you and it probably looks something like a demented elephant head i'm not sure but uh i actually made some footage a couple days after i got it cause right now it's peeling or else i'd like totally show you but um i made some footage like three days after i made that first video cause i was going to post a video like i promised but i didn't get around to finishing it so i'll just show you that cause that shows it pretty well and it's not peeling and it looks cool so here goes,,819
527,hi i was watching the video about brittany murphy and i understand i was in shock when i found out she died not so much that brittany murphy herself died but more that she died young like karen carpenter you know in cardiac arrest very young something that could have easily been preventable it makes me think about what am i going to do with my life um how much more time do i have to live what about people who are in iraq dying of preventable diseases like aids swine flu stuff like that brittany murphy at least is seems lived a full life despite that she died so young and it makes me think what are we going to do when we die i want you to listen to this clip i got from cmt and after i speak on it tell me what you think in case you don't recognize the song it's tim mcgraw's live like you were dying listen carefully i was in my early forties with a lot of life before me and a moment came that stopped me on a dime i spent most of the next days looking at the x rays and talking about the options and talking about sweet time i asked him when it sank in that this might really be the real end how's it hit you when you get that kind of news man whatcha do i went sky diving i went rocky mountain climbing i went two point seven seconds on a bull named fu man chu and i loved deeper and i spoke sweeter and i gave forgiveness i'd been denying some day i hope you get the chance to live like you were dying he said i was finally the husband that most the time i wasn't and i became a friend a friend would like to have and all of a sudden going fishing wasn't such an imposition and i went three times that year i lost my dad well i finally read the good book and i took a good long hard look at what i'd do if i could do it all again i went sky diving i went rocky mountain climbing i went two point seven seconds on a bull named fu man chu and i loved deeper and i spoke sweeter and i gave forgiveness i'd been denying someday i hope you get the chance to live like you were dying like tomorrow was a gift and you got eternity to think about what you'd do with it and what did you do with it and what can i do with it and what would i do with it sky diving i went rocky mountain climbing i went two point seven seconds on a bull named fu man chu and then i loved deeper and i spoke sweeter and i watched blue eagle as it was flying some day i hope you get the chance to live like you were dying to live like you were dying to live like you were dying as i think about that song you know this guy was in his forties and he was dying of cancer i know someone that lost her mother at the age of fifty from cancer and it makes me think this really makes me think by the way i'll bet oh sorry there we go we got that paused i'm sorry i was on cmt so it could take off i didn't realize i didn't have a pause but again that song makes me think you know what are we going to do we think we have forever and yet we do not life is finite think about all the people that have that you've lost in a year whether it be a friend in iraq or whether it be somebody's mother died of aids somebody's father died of cancer and for that for tim mcgraw i'll bet that song is very personal i do not believe he wrote it i don't think that um he writes most of his songs but but i'll bet you all didn't know he lost his father the year before nonetheless it is a very personal song and if you really listen to it doesn't it make you think i'm sure brittany murphy too thought that she was going to live forever i'm sure all of us think but now after seeing her death you know just reminds us shouldn't we treat every day as if that day were our last thank god for that reminder rest in peace brittany,,769
528,hello everyone this is the and it is official tiger woods has just admitted that transgressions have caused the integrity of his family to be in question here and if you haven't been following along there's been a lot of shit going down with mr woods and if you don't know who he is look him up he's a professional golfer you know perhaps you've heard of him and the other day he got in a car accident i'm probably gonna use the quote fingers a lot here uh he got in a car accident on fri last friday uh and it was reported that there was a possible martial dispute between he and his wife and a number of rumors have been circulating and it turns out that tiger woods was having a relationship and the specifics of the relationship you know not to you know throw tiger completely under the bus but the specifics of this relationship with one jamiee grubbs surfaced now a number of pieces of evidence have come fourth and one of which was a phone call that jamiee grubbs had on her phone and it was tiger calling her you know saying hey you know my wife is on us um please remove your my name from your phone so that way when i call it just shows up as a number not as you know tiger or whatever blah blah blah and it was it was basically tiger doing cover up work because he didn't want the truth of the matter to get out here which was basically his admission of guilt in the matter so the proof is in the pudding and tiger woods literally just put out a statement ah saying that he regrets the transgressions and i love the fact that he used transgressions and um such a such a lawyer word but um he put out this statement saying you know he he is sorry that what he has done has caused his family grief and um it may turn out that the uh the quote unquote accident that happened was his wife flipping the hell out and beating the shit out of him and his cadillac so it's it's kind of amazing here it and i find this amazing in a number of ways number one it's not really uh particularly anyone's business as to what exactly went down um i mean just i feel that people are gonna go too far with this and they're gonna delve in and try to find every detail and okay tiger woods is caught his hand is in the cookie jar he can't deny this he has the phone calls they have the car accident they have the pissed off wife i mean tiger's not gonna be able to recover from this and just you know pat everyone on the back and be like oops my bad let's all just move on so people are probably gonna delve into this too much but the reason why i said this is amazing is that this is another example of just another guy being a dumb shit now you guys have to understand tiger woods is just this multi million dollar commodity if you will he's this wholesome clean cut image that has been relatively flawless in his career and the path that he's chosen for his career i mean he is the go to guy that you would want advertising your product he's the guy a politician would want endorsing him he is everything and yet he got caught up in a relationship outside of his marriage that could have nothing but damning ramifications if things were discovered why the hell tiger would you risk all that just for some pussy and let's be realistic that's what it was have you seen this girl i don't think tiger was talking to her cause she's you know great conversation at the dinner table maybe he was okay i'll give him the benefit of the doubt maybe he was but you know what she's a piece of ass she's hot as hell i mean you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out why tiger was talking to this girl so it just one thing i just want to say out there is just these guys who get caught in relationships like this how can you not be petrified of going into a relationship like this tiger is married tiger has two kids tiger has this career and this public image that is flawless what if this jaimee grubbs girl wanted to blackmail him and for all we know maybe that's what happened here maybe she was trying to get some information out of him and got this voicemail and other information she will sell it to the highest bidder at this point and rumor has it us weekly paid one hundred and fifty thousand dollars just for that voicemail that got released that tiger had called jaimee with so why do people like tiger woods risk everything just for some extramarital relationship like tiger was it really worth it was it worth it to risk your entire career and god knows how much you're gonna be able to recover from this cause your squeaky clean image is shot i mean not to take anything away from his golf play because he's gonna go down as the greatest man to ever play that sport and yes i call it a sport even though some people will argue it's not a sport but anyways um i don't know i just i just find this amazing it's just it's just another squeaky clean guy that everyone could look up to he just let people down he just let people down with this i mean it's like you're in a happy marriage that well looks happy i mean we don't know behind closed doors but why can't you just be happy with the wife and the kids and everything and just set a good example and like i said tiger what the hell would you have done if this lady decided to blackmail you you don't think that there's people out there uh just women and men for that matter that are trying to find uh multi millionaires to con out of their money and get a inch of information that they can blackmail you with turns out this jaimee grubbs had a lot more than that and like i said not that she's absolutely blackmailed him but boy if she wanted to do that he gave her quite a bit of information to do so with so i don't know people what the hell do you think is tiger woods just retarded for this because in all honesty that's the only way i can look at it it's just an absolute act of just retarded behavior you have the world in the palm of your hand and you're just gonna throw it away with shit like this shame on you tiger what the hell where you thinking so anyways here people um yeah i'm sure there's gonna be more details to come out on this and i'll probably end up making a follow up video cause i don't think we've heard the half of it yet cause there is gonna be a lot more to be said and uh we're probably gonna have to buckle up but like i said it isn't really anyone's business anything else that happened beyond this but um yeah go ahead and drop your thoughts and opinions i'm sure you guys have your own renditions of what you think went down here but um tiger disappointed in you um you know i don't really care too much about golf but i can respect your game and uh that image you held out as being an upstanding citizen and you know having the wife and kids and all that it's all gone now it's all shot it's all shot you're just you're just now no more than a typical male that cheated on his wife and yeah cheated includes even if you didn't have any sort of sexual relationship cheating involves all that was going on cause like i said that phone message you left her that didn't sound like someone you know you didn't want to talk to because you were talking about world affairs over dinner with so yeah tiger shame on you and um god knows how much you're gonna be able to recover from this and god knows what else is gonna come out but i'll be watching to see what else comes out next cause yeah it's gonna be a bumpy ride for you have a great day everyone,,1464
529,hiya today's vlog is brought to you by echo echo echo echooo see how the only purpose why i'm making this video is because i recorded something earlier just to try it um if you could hear the echo in this room through the camera or through the camera and yes you can and i think that it's funny because this is the room where i always recorded my videos when i was at my dad's you know the one with the red chair there's no red chair anymore because some that the entire room is empty it's empty and it's dirty because um behind all the furniture there is dirt and i don't know how old that dirt is but it's probably probably old and disgusting let me show you what i mean i'm going to give you a three hundred and sixty of my empty room isn't that exciting i know i know yeah i see um okay so there it starts wall there urr ah ah there eww eww ich my nails eww gross okay moving on my door um a coke bottle i forgot to sweep up and eww look at that eww disgusting am am i pointing i don't i can't see the screen i don't know but eww eww okay so i'm just gonna do this i have no idea what i'll find in the house but i'm sure you can see that is disgustingly dirty and there there there see that eww eww eww eww there oh yuck there you see that ah gross gross err anyway um yeah that was my room hah exiting oh and if i didn't realize that i'm lying on the floor and the floor is just as dirty as the walls but then again my toes are dirty from throwing all that stuff out and worn from carrying boxes that seem to be like i don't know just as heavy as me and it's just my back does not feel too cheerful let me tell you that anyway ah so that's the only purpose why i am making this video because i thought that it was funny to have such an echo in a room that used to be not echoey at all and the same echo always reminds me of mr echo um yeah i don't know what i'm saying now i just thought that i'd make a video and i like the color of my socks and the end the end the end the end the end the end the end,,426
530,hey guy good night everyone this is so unfair um it is after midnight here and actually i had intended to just go to sleep and make a video tomorrow maybe but after reading my comments and my private messages and reading the comments on my channel i just had to say hello hello the reason why i didn't make a video any sooner was because my weekend is occupied with car problems as you know i have a small car and i travel long distances i travel a lot all over holland and my car has been giving me trouble for i think a month now every time i go on the highway it will just start shaking and the garage couldn't find out what was wrong but now they do know it's the gas pump and it's going to cost me a lot of money but that isn't what i wanted to tell you what i wanted to tell you first of all is thank you for the comments and for well making me feel like i'm being heard and that is wonderful and that is going to be my message today to keep on trying always keep on trying even when you think that what you are doing is not worth it a teacher of mine asked me two weeks ago what it was that i wanted to what the message was that i wanted to give to people or not the message not so much but the impression i wanted to leave on people i've thought about it for two entire weeks and i couldn't come up with an answer i couldn't i thought i wanted people to like me and therefore usually i hide and say nothing i thought if i'd be quiet and just accept everything people would like me this youtube experience has taught me that that is not the case people will always comment on how my nose looks wrong or my overall face is not good today or and it's not my goal to be liked i want to defend people who cannot voice what they have to say and are silent and usually the silent ones are the ones with great opinions and i think they need to be acknowledged and that is what i hope to do to acknowledge everyone who has his or her pretty opinions or strong devotions or dreams or hopes or aspirations i think most people are very beautiful i'm not talking about outside opinions i'm talking about inside for so long i felt i wasn't being heard and you often made me feel like i am and that i'm actually portraying something good and now i know what it is that i want to leave people i want people to think of me as someone who acknowledges who understands and i hope you think i'm actually succeeding and i hope that you know that you mustn't give up like i haven't given up on me on anorexia on young people people should be who they are and you should be who you are and no matter how rude comments are i will always be and not someone else but you guys can only give me more self esteem give me more courage give me more make me believe in myself more but not less definitely not less i don't easily get moved by much but you have moved me so i just wanted you to know that i thank you very much and i wish you all a good night,,596

532,hey everyone i just want to talk about something that has been in the news lately well at least american news and it's the balloon boy for all of you international viewers who don't know who the balloon boy is apparently there is this family who lives in colorado and they are crazy and they basically believe in aliens and do all this weird like scientist shit except not real science because they believe in all this wacky crap and basically they set off a balloon not like a little toy balloon but this weird spaceship shaped balloon and the father set it off and then they realized they couldn't find their son they thought their son was in the balloon and we've been calling him the balloon boy for the past day or so and he was like and the balloon was floating over colorado for two hours and for two hours we all thought that this boy was floating in this balloon and then the balloon lands and we realized that it's empty and we realized the boy was actually in the attic of the house and he wasn't in the balloon and we were all just talking about a balloon floating in the sky for two hours yeah so it's understandable that we would cover that because you know there was a chance that this boy could have died he was like floating around in space but he wasn't that's the point he wasn't in the balloon and even though we're learning more about this family how they're kinda of crazy and how they are bad parents but um that's not news that's really that's not news um and even though it's not news our media has decided to cover it twenty four seven by our media i mean cnn fox which no one should watch and msnbc these three major news stations even my beloved msnbc can't stop talking about the balloon boy honestly really the stock market just went over ten thousand or whatever for the first time in over a year it's going up it's going up do you remember i said that in my last video people like yeah barak obama it's going up and it's hit a record point for over a year but we're talking about a little boy that we thought was in a balloon that wasn't really the health care debate is finally coming to like to a merging point where the congress and the senate have to like agree to merge a final bill and we're talking about a boy who we thought was in a balloon but wasn't really you know when our society crumbles before our eyes and when sarah palin takes over the world with glenn beck and rush limbaugh and we look back at where did we all go wrong it's when our media started talking about the balloon boy it's when our media decided that the balloon boy was more important to discuss than the stock market healthcare the economy you know the stimulus package that is working by the way you know big stuff like that no no no we're going to talk about the balloon boy and even after the balloon boy has landed we're going to talk about how bad the parents of the balloon boy are and then we're going to put that family on every single freaking news show in the next twenty four hours interview after interview and watch the little boy he literally threw up on television on the today show this morning he threw up he vomited on television news show after news show this is what we're talking about you know barak obama harry reid nancy pelosi healthcare go merging fuck that stimulus bill it's working more signs that it's working fuck that stock market hits ten thousand for the first time in over a year fuck that we're not even talking about like anything that could possibly be twisted to be related to current events no we're talking about the balloon boy you know thomas jefferson talked about an enlightened electorate and electorate and the only way that democracy can succeed is if we have an enlightened electorate meaning that voters know know what they are talking about how are we supposed to know what we are talking about when the people who are supposed to tell us are talking about a balloon boy,,741
533,hey everyone i'm s mom um i'm also known as um okay so this is my first video so i'm a little nervous and it might be a little retarded but um after talking to which i'm sure most of you've been you know um she told me to make one and i did so um i just got back from um the food network night um with a couple of moms and it was delicious the food was amazing like i made um um strawberry and peach cobbler and it was a little rubbery the cobbler really didn't come up like stayed at the bottom so it was it was good but it was like rubbery um then i also made potatoes which were also really really good then everybody else made awesome recipes and i'm stuffed and it's one thirty in the morning and i'm making a video um but i figure since my hair was kinda nice um that i would make a video now instead of tomorrow um and it's in black and white because um it doesn't show the flaws but don't tell anybody that um so i'm gonna try to blog not every day but sometimes see how i like it if i get i great response i'll continue if not then i won't um i really don't want to make videos that no one reply to them or nothing because then that's stupid i'll just feel dumb so we'll see how it goes um i even thought about doing a um blog for coupons because i am a coupon freak i'm one of those ladies that stand at the check out lane for thirty minutes while they scan my coupons um i do purchases like before coupons to a hundred and something dollars up to coupons lower than twenty bucks so i'm really like crazy about them so i figure i could maybe teach some few people on here if i get some interest if not then i'll just make goofy videos um and i really don't know how to edit videos but i'm gonna try and we'll see what i can come up with um i think that's it for now um like i said its one thirty in the morning i probably should get some sleep since i have no child tonight um so i hope that you guys enjoy this video,,401
534,so yes this is really is me this is look my hair it's gone bye bye i was actually gonna wait until um after the wedding and next summer to cut my hair short but given the style of of the gown and i kept looking at up dos and i just didn't really see any that really went with what i wanted i kinda decided to go ahead and do it down but i didn't want it like long and down so um right now it's flipped under but i can flip it out and it can be all because it's layered so i know i'm sure all of you will have an opinion i hate it i love it how could you you look ugly now oh you're gorgeous i don't care i really don't care to hear any of it i didn't do it for you guys and i got permission from my mom and and uh not that it matters uh not permission but you know what i mean so um i just kinda wanna update you guys um a couple of things one is we are close to three hundred dollars raised on the poverty project which sounds not like not that much when you consider everyone but if you think of it another way we're ten percent of the way there and ten percent's quite a bit it's quite a bit you know so i'm keeping my fingers crossed that um i'm not gonna let it go i'm not going to so um if you guys are sick and tired of hearing me talk about it but you still love me to death then you're just going to have donate so we get the three thousand and i quit asking you to go donate by the way go donate on myspace blog um fineloss has a donate button whatever the last blog i have a donate button on is that's the most recent total that's where i keep updating because i have so many i don't go back and update every single total i update the most recent one um let's see um more news um i just get heard a little more from youtube about this gathering thing um i just got um they sent us a flip uh cam video camera which rocks um i already had one now apparently i'll have two and i'm going to definitely use both um not not double fisted i won't be like whooo look at all that yeah you know no but takes a lot of video of um the doggie cat which i sh don't tell because it might not you know don't it's not for sure yet but they're they're discussing the cat and dog are having some talks about having a merger and if they do so they would have their own channel so and and they just the biggest thing right now is they can't decide on a name would it be the ophelia and justice show or the justice and ophelia show see justice says that he should get precedence because no one has seen him yet really and everyone wants to see his puppy videos and him growing up and we have all those videos and he thinks that there's some power to that you know he thinks that um that exclusivity should get him the first name but then ophelia is like hey i've already been on youtube i'm tried and true i have fans they love me they're gonna stick by me bitch she calls him bitch even though he's not a bitch he's a male dog um but that that's her you know she calls she calls us all bitch at times um well she's probably called me a bitch when she doesn't have as much hair to lick and eat on anymore um so yes um that's probably where the other flip phone is gonna go for but just so you guys know i'm gonna give a shout out i know i don't ever do it on this channel um i don't ever talk about companies or anything except for my personal one but hey shout out to uh flip phones uh looks like the brand is m i-n o mino i don't know but but flip video um they're awesome literally i mean because i i bought one before i'm not just saying they're awesome because they gave me a free one i

535,hey how's that okay so i just finished telling how the story of my gender marker needing changed in court i went to would you behave yourself no you're done are you done okay so i take my signed order to the dmv to get my license changed and i and i'm waiting in line and i'm like this could get fun of course the most conservative not so nice looking lady says may i help the next person please so i go up and i give her the form i signed and filled out and i'm like so okay i don't need to renew my license but i need to change my gender marker and she just looks at me like huh i said i just got a court order i just got my gender marker changed and need to change it so i give her the order she looks over it and says i don't know if we can do this i said that order says that you have to so she's looking over it and she's like i just i don't know if we can do this so i read to her the part that says it is ordered that all public offices change all documents blah blah blah to reflect the new gender blah blah whatever legal speak i don't remember what the hell i wrote and so at this point she says well you know i'm just not comfortable with this i don't think i can do i'm not going to do this so i said i need to speak to your manager so she me and then this other fantastically pleasant looking individual comes up to me and she like says what seems to be the problem i said well i got my gender marker changed this morning and i asked her if she could change it for me and she said that she doesn't feel it's ethically correct to do so and so i had to ask for you and she looks at it and she's like well you know i just don't know how i feel about this i don't think that i can do this either and so i grabbed the order and i said this is a court signed order it says it is ordered and ordered is in bold print here i didn't say that it was in bold print but just looking at the document you can see its bold print and so i read it to her she's like well i guess we have no choice do we i was like no you don't she tells the other lady well go ahead and do it then i love the way they get all shitty and snotty with me and print the thing out and hand it to me and she's like here you go and so i signed it she's like i need your left thumb print over here and your right thumb print over here and then she takes my picture and i'm sure that i'm smiling like a fool in this picture because i mean not only did i just get my gender marker changed by myself it kind of pleases me to force people to do things that they don't want to do in respect to this i know it's wrong but i can't help it so i get my you know paper id i have to wait like six to eight weeks for my photo id yah so i you know i stroll on over to social security office and by stroll i mean get in my car and drive a mile or two and you know whatever and so the the lady called me in social security and she was far more pleasant she just asked for you know i i told her what was up and i gave her the order and she was like okay i need your id and so i gave her my paper one and she was like do you have anything with the picture on i said here's my old one that still says female and then she verified some information on me that they have and she asked me if i need a new card and i say no because i still have my card and it doesn't have a gender marker on it she says okay have a nice day and i'm like oh you too so i finished all that up and i'm super excited and then i had to go to work fail but yeah so i get off work and i go to a bar to celebrate with my friends and they had all left cause they all had big girl jobs and big boy jobs so i went to the bar tonight because so more shit happened at work that's not so good but that's for another story so yeah i'm legally male my driver's license and social is changed i have to work out my passport and other such documentation but yeah life is good and i win i'll catch you later bye,,854
536,hey youtube it's real name no gimmicks how's it going people due to the success of the review review which i thank everybody very much for watching i'm going to do another computer game review and today's computer game review i'm going to do today is now i've got the limited hardened edition copy where can i begin now really this game has got so much hype it had so many commercials trailers and even a little trailer the hype of this game was tremendously huge i could not believe it it was just so unbelievable it's a game here like last year that was tremendously high it was also the very first ever video game to receive a film premier style at london's leicester square which was absolutely amazing with this it just shows how far computer games have become and also not only that on the first day of the uk launch it sold one point twenty three million copies it's just it's unbelievable it's absolutely fantastic i'll tell you it makes it the biggest selling computer game on its first day ever it's just so unbelievable it beat of for or five double ok enough about the hype and all the trailers and all the commercials i've been sort of talking about now let's talk about the game well in this review i'll also be showing you game play footage of me playing the game all right okay so we're gonna do a bit of a crossfire against different enemies which is really cool okay now for the story line the main campaign load it takes place five years after the original call of duty game the marines and the uas fought the other day in action that beat the ultra nationalists in russia unfortunately though their sort of little plan had backfired it turned out that zakhaev who was the main big bloke of the original game was revered as a martyr and hero when it came to makarov a former lieutenant of zakhaev decides to take over all of europe and put out so many terrorist attacks all over across europe including russia at the very beginning of the game i played private allen just to try to get used to the swing of things of the game no really you start off with training and then you go off to afghanistan and go to siberia and then you head into mother russia as a cia operative and this is where the controversy comes in politicians and the media have gotten involved with this particular level level three where you work as a cia operative join up with makarov and shoot enough civilians at the local russian air to me though i found this level a little bit queasy because i found it quite in the big shock value but i feel like the media and politicians have taken this level a little bit too far and only based it on judgment of hype about video clips of the airports that were being shown rather than playing that particular level as well but one thing i do like with just before you start the campaign mode you do get an option to actually skip that particular level or decide to play it and then it once you get into that particular level and decide oh this is a bit too queasy or a bit too harsh or a thing and that you can actually skip that particular level it's not with any other level as well i like that little feature as well it's kinda like really really cool after the controversial level three you will be playing as many other different soldiers that including sergeant roach who works for the task force one forty one okay so we're now going to a mission in brazil now enough about talking about the storyline what about the game itself i feel like there is a when i play in single player mode it's a little bit too easy but it's kinda like really cool the levels are really really intense there's loads and loads of action going on especially from the very first level when you first start it's absolutely fantastic i love it the graphics are so detailed you get it in there when you get shot you saw i have blood going across the screen and that it's really really quite cool it's makes it so like really realistic as well they put in a lot of details as well which is actually fantastic with the building size the building and it's got a lot of various different weapons whether it's like a desert eagle an a k forty seven or rifle shotgun or a sniper gun and it's really it's quite cool you can pick up many many different weapons along the way to me i was thinking like this is going to be like another first person sort of shoot out and it is sort of the way is i mean to me i kinda have a dislike though for first person shooters some of them are really good but most of them are sorta like oh they're just all the same this sort of thing like far cry two like i was saying i feel like the campaign mode doesn't add enough storyline and development sort of thing i feel like it could be carried off a lot more better there are a number of different locations you can travel across i don't know there were a number of different locations with this game which makes this probably a real epic first person shoot out which includes from afghanistan siberia america brazil and even going into a mission out into outer space in one particular point as well which i find really cool i love the attention and detail though of the siberia level when you're out climbing those mountains i find it a bit of a struggle though to climb those mountains at first but after a little bit of time i really got the hang of it which is really cool you can drive a number of different vehicles including the snowmobile which i found really fun and enjoyable though on the second level now i haven't finished the campaign mode but i have found it a little too easy though just to get sort of thing they're very very small levels and it doesn't have too much depth to it i think it was more focused on the graphics though and the voice acting speaking about the voice acting i think it's absolutely superb yeah news is better there are two other different modes in this game you have the special ops team where you have play different types of missions to gain stars sort of thing where you need to do training races try to shoot people down try to take out all kinds of guys i think this is absolutely fantastic you can play this on your own or play with a friend though really as well i think this is actually a really neat idea it makes it really cool and that's what brings in the fun sort of thing i think this is one of those features that's a lot better though than the main campaign mode i did try to complete one of the special ops where i had to try and kill make thirty kills without killing more than six civilians which i kept on failing all the time but it's a nice little neat challenge it makes you try and make and try and figure out which is the best option to go through to help to take out the entire gang i think this is really good the strategy in this game is absolutely brilliant the ai is really really good and the main reason that people have bought yeah that's right it's the multi player with these death matches it's like eight players for everybody going at each other it's really kinda like really fancy stuff i've played it a couple of times it is really good the multiplayer is absolutely phenomenal the nine on nine mode is actually is true you can do it in teams and there's also yeah you can have the individual free form where you're it's for every man to themself that's what i've been mainly been playing i've really had a real kick out of it as well i have had so much fun over it and i will be keep on playing the multiplayer as well when you pick up points for the multiplayer you can pick up new weapons new perks new equipment which eventually in the near future you'll be able to drop bombs over the enemies as well i've had a few bombs dropped on me as well and it's not a pleasant sight i've been in the multiplayer mode with somebody you can play on for hours and hours and hours and the same there with the special ops just to make yourself real really better though really i bet those are the two best modes though of the entire game okay what about the negatives i feel like the campaign mode's storyline isn't really juicy isn't really sorta like really strong as i thought it would be but they do have a couple of twists and turns as well within the story i'm hoping to really look forward to find out what these are the pricing for the game including this i paid like seventy pounds i think is a bit too much though really but it does come with a nice couple of little goodies again the price again is a bit of a problem like forty five pounds just for the game by itself but i bet you they just want to be different from the rest of the market but other than that i've been seeing it's a bit pricey but it's still worth the money so if you do want to buy i think that you may want to play with a friend or play with a lot of people online though it's just a really really good game on those special types of things okay so i'm going give you like two different slightly ratings here for the campaign single player mode i'd probably give maybe three and a half with the multiplayer with special ops i'm going to give four and three quarters yeah i bet this is more of a game though that you want to play with your friends online overall i give this game probably four and a quarter now i know some of you are going to think yeah that's a bit of a controversial market

545,yup yup tomorrow i hit the quarter century mark let's move on knight life by peter david the first you might want to know about knight life is that as you might have been able to tell from the cover picture it is arthurian legend but it is not for arthurian legend purists peter david the author looked at several arthurian legend books including le morte d'arthur by sir thomas mallory the once and future king and the book of merlyn by t h white the last enchantment and other assorted titles by mary stewart and he says in the forward all of the above have been carefully read or purchased or checked out from the local library and never returned by the author of this work in the preparation of this manuscript the author has at the very least skimmed the flap copies sell copy and table of contents of all of the above plus many other titles too numerous or obscure to mention so while there are a lot of things that ring true with arthurian legend there are also a lot of inaccuracies but the point of this novel is not to be accurate to the nth degree with the arthurian legend the point of this novel is to make you laugh so if you're an arthurian legend purist i would either recommend that you not read this book or that you do read this book and chill a little bit thanks so this book basically asks the question what if king arthur were to return from avalon or his healing place today and therefore would be subject to the modern political system that is essentially what happens in this book arthur returns and is found wandering around th century new york city wearing a suit of armor and arthur soon realizes that this new society and this new political system is not merely going to accept him as king just because he says he is and so he begins his rise back to power by running for mayor of new york city so already it's hilarious king arthur is running for mayor of new york city yeah so he's not alone in his endeavor to run for mayor of new york city his campaign manager is of course good ol merlin unfortunately at the moment merlin is in the guise of an eight year old boy because in order to stay immortal merlin has made it so that he actually ages backwards arthur also has his personal assistant gwen who looks alarmingly like somebody he used to know and of course percival the immortal grail knight but it's not just the good guys that have come back uh morgan le fay is still around and causing mischief along with arthur's bastard son mordred who is actually the campaign manager for the other guy so the book watches arthur as he struggles to understand this new society and this new political system and most especially these people the people of the twentieth century are so vastly different from the people of arthur's time largely because of their just general apathy and arthur is appalled by this apathy in the people who are voting for their leaders and so he tries to instill some passion and some caring in them see basically arthur is that candidate that crazy independent candidate who runs for office not with any expectation of winning but just to get his views out there and to hold the other candidates accountable the only difference is that arthur has every intention of winning and in fact has a pretty decent of doing so his views are extremely antiquated and yet they resonate with an alarming number of people and a lot of people flock over to his side and soon he is a major contender for the mayor of new york city so much so that morgan le fay and mordred have to put a stop to it obviously this book is a comedy and it makes fun of a lot of different things uh including new yorkers the media new yorkers the american political system new yorkers politicians uh did i mention new yorkers of course we see arthur being incredibly na ve about this new world that he finds himself in but through all the comedy there's also a lot of good messages in this book in fact a lot of the messages are the same messages as the arthurian legend one of the things that i like about the character of arthur is that i don't always agree with him but the point that arthur makes is that it is not his purpose to make people agree with him it's to make people think it's to get people out of that apathetic state that they found themselves in and make them think about the issues and about why they elect the people that they elect he recognizes that the power of leadership does not really lie with the leaders but the people that support those leaders one of the fun things about this book is that every so often in between chapters you'll have ye old sound bite which is something which is essentially from the television or radio a news report or a commercial or something along those lines which both makes fun of the media and also just shows how much of an influence the media really has peter david incidentally is much kinder to the media than say dan brown is so i enjoyed this book every bit as much on the reread as i did the first time that i read it there is a sequel which is about the search for the holy grail but i haven't actually read that one yet i'm hoping to actually read it now but knight life by peter david is still a favorite and i would highly recommend to each of you that you read it especially if you're a fan of the arthurian legend the next book in the favorite series is going to be paper towns by john greene but you're gonna have to wait a little bit before you see it i'm taking a brief and by brief i mean like two weeks a brief hiatus from this project largely because by my own rules of the project i can't reread a book until it's been at least a year since i last read it and so i'm going to be waiting until about october eighteenth before i start reading paper towns and i probably could fit in another couple of books in between there but i've decided to do a little catching up on my regular reading which has kinda fallen by the wayside and so that's that and the next time you see me i will be twenty five years old oh my god til then see you next time,,1154

547,good morning i am and this is hank sock a sock version of me hello and the and i are here to tell you some very exciting news i guess a couple of months ago and i decided that we were really interested in the possibility of getting a real life online video conference in order to get all of the best online video creators together in the same place and the communities that support those groups in order to get like uh uh an entire epic gigantic weekend of fun and growing the community and doing awesome things that's your big news yeah that that's my i mean the news is that we're actually gonna do it and it's gonna be this summer in los angeles from july ninth to july eleventh your big news is that a bunch of you and your nerdy friends are gonna get together and drink juicy juices and hang out and talk about nerdy stuff well i mean i don't think that you understand that online video is is like a really huge deal well i got ingrown toenail that's a really huge deal but i'm not making a conference about it um i'm having a really hard time figuring out how you could have an ingrown toenail well yeah it's complicated anyway online video is an entirely new medium it's creating new genres and really active engaged and a large communities of people believe it or not there are probably going be like a hundred thousand people watching this video that we're making right now hmm out of my hair um your hair is surprisingly sparkly i never noticed that your hair was sparkly yeah i use product what nothing don't worry about it so who's gonna be there uh well a lot of people are gonna be there people from all the way from like to but also people from all over the world of online video we've got michael buckley dave dayes jay carl brittney louis taylor ray william johnson david choy redin link mitchell davis me my brother julian noons natalie tran i can't believe we have freaking natalie tran shane dawson shane dawson yeah shane dawson i love that guy yeah i know i love him too feel better shane the success of these of these projects isn't based on like million dollar marketing budgets or or the ungodly beauty of the people who started them well that's for sure yeah thanks it's based on what i think is the raw ability to entertain and people who are able to bring people into the communities so that they watch every new video that gets put up not just when they light their face on fire or capture a particularly adorable cat moment god i love that cat yeah i know i love that cat too but the cat's not gonna be there we couldn't get the cat for the conference but there are going to be many of the most successful people in online video and that list that i gave you earlier isn't even a complete list and we're gonna have demonstrations and we're gonna have talks and performances by these people we're gonna have concerts and dance parties and we're gonna have all kinds of crazy things that we can't even think of yet and we're gonna ask the community to present ideas for us like karaoke karaoke is a very good idea thank you that's an excellent idea i want a ball pit a ball pit yes a ball pit is another great idea do you have other ideas what about a booth where charlie mcdonough sits and he bites people's fingers so they can say ouch ouch charlie i will talk to charlie about that there's gonna be an insider track that's gonna be basically for people who are really into youtube and wanna like get down on the down and dirty specifics of creating a community on youtube and the business and and the future of youtube it is gonna cost money it's the registration is going to cost money because these things cost a lot of money to put on if you wanna find out more there's lots more information on the website which is at vidcon twenty ten dot com and you can check out our twitter feed at twitter com vidcon and our youtube channel of course youtube com vidcon i think that's all i wanted to talk about we'll see you at vidcon,,754
548,what's up you guys um normally i would post two videos in the same day but i feel like what i have to say is extremely important enough for me to do so so um i was just presented with a situation and before i even start this this is going straight to the person who caused me to actually want to make a video about it because i realized that whenever someone is not sure about something or kind of in the blind or in the dark about a situation they come off sounding more stupid than they really are so it's no shame um even if they comment anyway okay a girl added me today on myspace and i had this thing on my page where you can contact me via mys i mean via yahoo and she aksed me was i gay right off the bat she asked me if i was bisexual to be more correct about the situation and i was like no i'm gay she paid it and she was like well it's been what it was like while it lasted blah blah blah blah blah and you know being gay you gonna you expect stuff like that so i really paid it cause i'm not interested in you anyway so girl it it doesn't matter to me um but then she came back here recent just a while ago and she was like uh i don't mean to bother you but i just wanted to know if being gay come natural or was there a error that had been while you were growing up now i'm i i'll answer that question on almost of occasion but it just pisses me off that every time someone brings up a situation about someone being gay it's always talked to some kind of negative aspect in a person's life like how the hell i mean not how but why the hell does being gay have to be tied to so many negative feeling actually being straight isn't all a walk in the park either um being part of a community and then being part of a sub community one me being a african american male and then two for me being a homosexual african american male it kinda puts me in a tough position because i really want to act immaturely and go off whenever i i receive statements like that but honestly i think that the best way to prove a point to someone is just to continue doing yourself and do it maturely um it's obvious and that it was just made clear to me that there's a lot of people in the dark about being homosexual but um and it kind the conversation ended up stopping because she didn't like one of my my answers and honestly i didn't even go off on the girl but i i don't know barak obama isn't the only one who can inspire change and i'm definitely gonna start making my walk about change because if a person if this people are still left in the dark about being a homosexual what homosexual people go through or how its come about then obviously we need to do more as a whole to give that situation talk about and discuss more thoroughly man this pr this video probably won't even hit home to a lot of people specially to those who don't put much thought into into it but i just feel like i needed to um say my little spill on it and there's so much more that i could say about it but i'm not even gonna waste anyone's time tomorrow is a day of thanks and we should all be blessed and thankful that we are alive breathing and kicking some of us well but some of not but we're still here making it and struggling so i don't know i'm just gonna be thankful for that and i'm going to definitely create a video tomorrow to which i'll leak after happy thanksgiving even though i probably get into many of you already but um still just because but y'all be careful and y'all take care and just uh discuss discuss the things that people aren't necessarily discussing be different make a change peace,,719

554,hi and welcome back to my video blog this is a new series that i want to start called uh the um i love ya um i've i discussed with some people about the title and some of you have said that being an atheist doesn't really change who you are and that is true i'm not an atheist atheist is not a label you can put on someone besides it's a lack uh it's not a lack of belief it's a non belief in god or gods uh which doesn't tell anything else other than that but by saying that this is because a lot of religious people out there a lot i personally as well have met have said that atheists are amoral uh have bad ethics uh and all in all are bad people so now we're going to take this from the perspective of a parent and talk about what it is to be a parent uh you didn't hear me ask me any questions irreligious or regarding parenting for for this series uh i am a father to a boy that is two years old now uh he was born in two thousand seven i'm twenty three years old so i was uh twenty one when he was born uh some some would call that a young parent i don't really regard myself as being young but i know that i'm young in the sense that i'm not old uh but i'm not so young that i can't take responsibility uh by uh responsibility responsibility for the upbringing of a child and be there as a parent for him um so yeah sorry i'm still a bit sick my son is at his mother's place we broke up uh a while ago you can look back in my video blogs to figure out when it is uh we're still communicating as friends and we we switch with him having him a week each and this is my week off um because i've got work this weekend i can't really have a boy of two years old running around at home alone while daddy is at work um but anyway how does being atheist come in uh when it comes regard when it comes to parenting um i don't really think that it comes down uh it doesn't really affect the child as much uh besides the fact that i think religious people are trying to push their dogma and belief onto their children basically brainwashing them or indoctrinating um you could say the same thing about politics uh i would never push uh my political views onto my son uh i don't think that would be possible because my ex girlfriend uh is on the other political well she's not the same political view as i do i'm very liberal uh yeah liberal socialist anyway uh but being an atheist doesn't mean you have bad moral or a total lack of moral or no morals at all or no ethics uh morals are basically there are a lot of videos explaining why you can have a moral without believing in god god's not necessary for there to be moral uh morality uh simplified is basically uh social uh decisions with social interactions uh i think fifty four talked about it in one of their videos that morality be bumped uh what i want to teach my child is respect for other people respect to people regardless of their age ethnicity race political views or religious views and by that said i know,,597
555,one last thing whoever sent me this yes i would very much like my legs back i don't know how you got them but i haven't been able to move from this seat for three days and my butt is starting to get very very chapped so send those back at any time i would really appreciate it so that i can get up and eat which is my favorite thing to do ps that means post script by the way did you know that congratulations to ch teau of a doubt for reaching fifty subscribers much love from me to you this is getting creepy i'll stop now i'm just going to go okay let's see how many women you can take off today yeah that's my life goal right there to be a woman you have to be caring and loving and a little unforgiving please don't hurt me think that men are pigs because if you don't then you will be seen as a traitor to your own gender apparently i'm pretty sure someone is going to shank me down in the night for saying that if you're a person of my age then when you were little you have to have gone to a slumber party where you dressed up as one of the spice girls i know all of you have done that don't even lie to me you have to have gone through a phase when you were little that you just thought makeup was the greatest thing ever invented and that you needed it love chocolate it is your best friend it will heal the sick and cure blindness be self critical no matter how good you look always turn to someone and ask does this make me look fat okay now i feel that i have ticked enough of you that i can turn twitter and avoid being shanked down in the middle of the night so here are what the people on twitter have to say about being a girl beef muffin hippo says that you have to look at yourself in every reflective surface you see because i don't know you think you have cheeseburger stuck on your face ellie says that you have to be interested in makeup be a good cook and please remember i am not saying this next part but you can't drive you're not good at driving according to teen lee you can never go anywhere alone even the bathroom which is disgusting and disturbed and i kinda don't want to hang out with any women ever again and justo says you have to have celebrity crushes and according to kate those would probably the jonas brothers or twilight characters or someone from hsm which i'm guessing is high school musical because i am the bomb at guessing acronyms emily says that you have to think that everyone is prettier and better dressed than you and feel self conscious michelle says you're good at makeup you're good a fashion you have a lot of drama and emotion you like to shop and you like men i'm a man do you like me you probably don't like me i'm sorry publishing tie yeah on the last video i made a giant mistake that i'm going to apologize for i asked something that you couldn't stand about the opposite gender big mistake on my part sorry about all the comments so instead on this one i'm going to ask for an acronym for obama and no nothing political obama just popped into my head for some reason old beavers always mall actors because they don't like actors apparently despite how some of the comments were utterly sexist i am going to show some comments that i found hilarious please do not shank me in my sleep for showing them i thank you,,645
556,okay so i'm trying something new i don't know if anybody is going to walk in honestly they're all asleep i think is not here anymore so i'm like looking around the camera at myself in the mirror that's very weird obviously i'm doing this video because i just put up a post i think last night on my blog which i will link in the sidebar about we used two makeup removers now i'm not trying to be over news because i suck at things like that and that's much left to irene but this is my favorite makeup remover and each of you know well makeup remover and as you can see i have not so much whirl win um i have not so much money right now so i had to go looking for one and i found the great eye makeup in the world and i'm turning in all different directions because i'm trying to watch to see what i'm doing in the shadows so what i'm going to do is i'm going to spill oil free makeup on my left side with neutrogena one and i'm going to do the equate on this eye and i'm going to compare them right cotton pad equate now make sure you get it in this bottle because the other bottle the weird bottle i don't know if i can find a picture of it i'll put it up now i'm not going to take all of it off i'm we're going to do a test i've got udpp a cover girl eye shadow mac eye shadow a milani liner a mixing medium brow pencil i got all that so what we're going to do is i can't do i hate this camera i can't zoom with the camera so i have to like come like this so one swipe i'm going to put it on and i'm going to hold it there for a couple of seconds i'm just going to wipe i don't even care if there's like residue that is one swipe apparently both my camera batteries are dead and so i'm going to try to do this real fast so that was one swipe with the equate one so here is another cotton pad neutrogena dumping it all over myself hold it for a few seconds so actually i can tell right now that it is no difference from the way they take the makeup off well one swipe each it's just as good as the equate it's just as good as the neutrogena in my opinion and now i'm going to shut this camera off go and charge the batteries and take this stuff off bye,,452

559,you guys ready for this here we go hello and welcome to the uh all right now this is an important video i've been putting it off for a while one of the reasons why i want to to do this now is cause i got a really great question about it hi my name is and i'm considering getting dreads and i've been reading a lot about using dread wax versus not using it and i was just wondering if you could tell me the advantages and disadvantages to using dread wax thanks for your question so i'm gonna try to cover all the advantages and the disadvantages of using dread wax um the right way and some of the rumors that have resulted because people have used it the wrong way quite a bit all right and as we'll see it's pretty easy to misuse it and that's one of the main problems before i i go much further i wanted to tell you that all my thoughts on this subject are completely unbiased uh i've used wax to start my dreads twice and i know that if i needed to start my dreads again i would definitely choose to use wax i know it works i mean i do know for like nine years now people have been using it and freaking out freaking out about how fast their dreads lock and they send pictures and they're like look at this these are only three months old yadda yadda love your stuff it's not like i can come at this like i don't really know like maybe wax is beneficial or not it's not really that big of a deal because i think the people that say what eew they're pretty biased too anyway let's talk the first rumor that we should talk about well there's two parts to it you have to use wax to lock up your hair or wax prevents the hair from locking okay now both of these are pretty popular neither of them are true so let's talk about how wax works and i think that'll kinda clarify some of this a little bit all right wax works by keeping the hair together when you compress it okay the natural dreading process is for the knots to tighten and the hair to get used to being in the knots just like hair in a braid gets used to being in a braid you know you put your hair in in all braids i don't know if you've ever done that i've never done that um anyway wait maybe i did so you wash it in a braid and then you take it out and it's all curly and wavy like a braid and that's because it's getting used to that shape all right well the hair gets used to knots exactly the same way and over time it gets so used to them that it can knot again tighter you tighten your knots and you compress the dread by palm rolling here we go palm rolling uh and by sleeping on them okay you crunch em down it gets all knotted and stuff and they sit there for a little while okay and then they're used to it and they're ready to crunch down and get tighter and they sit there and get used to it and they crunch down and they get even tighter and that's how you end up with a ridiculously tight rope like dreads that uh that everybody wants that's a mature dread which is usually what you're going for when you're growing dreads wax helps by preventing the hair from losing the progress while it's getting used to the knot all right if it is sitting there and you take a shower and all the you know everything opens back up again then you're starting all over pretty much or not quite all over not quite all over not quite all over i mean eventually you know it can still tighten but it's gonna take a lot longer because you've lost that progress when you have wax in the hair it holds that progress so it allows you to squeeze it down when you palm roll and then it kinda stays there eh it opens up a little bit it opens up a little bit but the majority of the progress that you've made when you tighten em down you get to keep that and that's the difference that's why wax helps the dreads mature faster another rumor that you'll hear that's kinda related to this is that wax works like glue okay it sticks the hair together and the hair the dreads can't mature well that's completely bullshit there might be some wax that works that way if there were yeah it wouldn't work that's true if you put glue in your dreads you're not it's not gonna lock up glue sticks the hair together and when you compress it it doesn't do anything all right so then when the glue finally comes out so do the dreads cause they cause the knots never tightened the other rumor uh that i mentioned where wax prevents the hair from dreading some wax does not good wax but a lot of the stuff out there that you'll find in the store is full of petroleum and they call it dread wax but it say you know contains one hundred percent pure beeswax yeah i bet it does it has like two grams in like this big jar you know unfortunately the rest of it and petroleum is a lubricant so you can imagine if you put it on your dreads and you tighten em down it's gonna make them open back up nice and quick like even faster than they would on their own if you end up with petroleum in your dreads just wash it out real good and get some good wax in there we have a lot of people that try the petroleum stuff first and then they're like can i save my dreads jolly clean and i'm like yeah man you can save em and they do and it's great so whatever don't worry it's all good actually got that question too again and it's that guy right there the last thing i want to mention there is your hair type your hair type determines how hard it is for your hair to lock some hair is more resistant to tightening okay really really straight coarse hair is gonna be the hardest think like asian hair okay each strand is really big and really straight so to get it to relax into a knot is gonna be much harder than if your hair is really really fine and really kinky and curly already really really fine and really kinky really kinky that's why some people have a harder time the good news is the wax gives it that extra hold so that it's gonna knot and it's gonna become dreads you know instead of being mature in maybe like four months it'll take six months or eight months maybe even a full year you know but you're gonna get dreads and it's not like a you know if thing it's a when thing uh rumor number two the not so much that's definitely not true and it's caused people a lot of problems people heard that dread wax made dreads lock faster and smoother and i want my hair to lock up really fast and i want it to be really smooth so i'm gonna use a ton of wax they caked it on like a hippy with a it doesn't work but it does make a mess any wax can be overused even if it's uh the best dread wax available it still can be overdone and it will still cause you problems when you overdo it a lot of people and you know you'll see them on message boards and stuff like that they've sworn off dread wax completely well why don't you tell me at the same time why they've associated over waxing with waxing and now they don't want to touch wax and you know their dreads are gonna take a little bit longer and that's fine whatever i'm not you know like you must use wax for your dreads obviously that's not true there's definitely a disadvantage to uh to overdoing it and you can avoid those disadvantages by not overdoing it dread wax doesn't hurt dreads over waxing hurts dreads it's like people don't kill people guns kill people or guns don't kill people people kill people how does that go again if you do decide to use wax use it properly over waxing is a disorder it's like uh overeating you know so don't do that oh let's talk about some of the rumors that are related to over waxing waxing uh oh waxing makes you feel waxy no that's not true but one of the things that i like least about using wax is that even when you put the right amount in and you work it in well you're still gonna feel it in the hair uh for about a day or so you're gonna feel it you know on your hands when you touch your hair and stuff and that's annoying a lot of people don't like tacky wax feeling on their dreads and dude i'm right there with you the good news is you can get around that just by putting a little bit of dread butter on the surface of the dreads if you're gonna use wax you should have it on hand cause it really makes a huge difference just the whole experience is gonna be better honestly you can put it on right after you put on the wax so the surface that you're touching or that other people are touching is not tacky yeah because you feel the dread butter and the dread butter is smooth and you don't feel the tacky wax and it smells really freaking awesome people will be trying to eat your dreads and stuff you'll be like no don't eat my dreads it's odd it's like that really gotta love it and that pretty much takes care of that this is it for part a man you can go watch part b,,1738
560,hello everyone it's been a long time since i made a video so i thought that i probably should not much has been up with me on halloween i dressed up as a fairy and i've still been trying to find a job i actually had an interview today so hopefully the job soon it's now been a little over two months since i have been back to america and i have started to really miss japan a lot lately i had a lot of people ask me before whether i preferred living in america or japan and you know there are pros and cons of living in both countries so of course it's going to depend on the individual person i'd probably say that if all of my family and my good friends lived in japan and i knew how to speak and understand japanese fluently then i probably would rather live in japan it feels like when i was in japan i was just less stressed out relaxed and i just had a good feeling while i was there in america of course i can understand the language and it might be a little easier to do everyday things here but i do miss the friendly polite people in japan and i miss the scenery and architecture even totally just because i've lived in america for so many years that it's just boring to me now i don't know how people from other countries view american architecture but it feels like to me anyway i prefer the architecture in other countries i actually at one point had a list of a lot of ideas for videos that i wanted to do and i tried finding the list and i can't find it i made the list in japan but i made sure that i packed it so that i'd have it here um so hopefully i'll be able to find that soon and make some more more planned videos you can see a little bit of my apartment in the background this apartment complex was built in the nineteen sixties so there's some lovely wood paneling behind me i'm not so into the wood paneling but it's pretty cheap rent so i can handle it probably one of the reasons i haven't been on youtube in so long is that i kind of got addicted to netflix and dexter i've been watching a lot of movies i just saw a lot of footage that i haven't put together from japan so i'll try to do that soon too for you guys and i will have to leave you goodbye,,441
561,that was three of my top brackets these actually haven't all of all three of them and i would like to know what your brackets are and you can either make a video response or if you've got any comments video response would be much better for this because i think it requires a degree of emotion and of course presentation if you'd like to just explain it or make an actual video like i did a full video with an action then that would be cool as well i'll watch them all i'll try to read all the comments thanks for watching this i really appreciate it i can't wait to hear from everyone who participates so goodbye and i hope you enjoyed this video hello so i was just um sitting down laying around eh when i thought of a concept recently i had read a novel the last king of scotland and em i spent quite a lot of time reading the text and i noticed one thing about the book there was a lot of em use of brackets or if you're american parentheses i believe it's called basically you em you read the book and you get the dialogue and the writer but sometimes in the book the writer likes to the character who the writer is em has wrote about likes to elaborate on on a subject or likes to give their real opinion as opposed to what they said in the book so you might have like something like oh yeah sure i'll do this and then in brackets it'll say like i did not want to do this something like that or it it'll provide more detail now i was thinking about if there were brackets in real life like say you were asked a question and you reply to this question what you say may not may or may not be honest it may be em a lie white or otherwise maybe the true feelings it may not have been expressed in the response i'd just like to share with everybody here a few of my brackets or what my brackets would be if we were able to see what people thought or or if you were able to elaborate on something you'd already said i'll just em show you now so michael i want you to clean this entire floor as quickly as possible if you don't get it cleaned enough em i'm gonna make you stay until four thirty i'll get right on it i had a really great day michael me too,,434

563,so like i wanted to bring up a really kind of interesting point uh first off you know i'm still shocked that michael jackson is gone um i have nothing but respect for him i just wanted to bring up a point about some of the rumors that are spread about him and just offer you a little bit of insight on what those might mean so like a lot i've talked to those know that people like to jump on the wagon of spreading rumors and let's face it rumors don't really involve any kind of thinking and a lot people don't like to think so perfect there's your audience base people in the media know that the more extreme something sounds the more people are gonna wanna watch it and listen to it and that's why some of these rumors get spread about him okay like one of the funny things is is that a lot of the media personalities who say these horrible things about michael jackson they don't really believe them but that's how they get views and that's how their shows get attention but like you know the only thing that's really left to say about michael jackson is you know number one he is gone and number two he left us with amazing music and um you know i really think we could just let that be,,233

568,hey friends it's and i am doing an update um i am feeling so much better than i was feeling on monday on my last video um i remember or if you remember if you watched it i was whining that i've been losing and gaining the same five pounds for over three months now and you know i'm a hundred and sixty pounds a hundred fifty nine this morning um whatever okay just whatever so um let me tell you why i'm feeling better when i was doing the couch to five pay program i was like so excited about running because like you should start with sixty second sprints at week one and i was like oh my god i can't run sixty seconds i can't run oh i'm gonna die i'm gonna die i can't even run down the driveway anyway and so when i would run sixty seconds and i made it through the whole week being able to do that at that very last run when it was over it was like oh my god oh my god i am finished i had graduated week one i'm on to week two and then all during the weekend before i started week two i was thinking oh my gosh it's ninety second sprint how am i gonna do that i thought i was gonna die at sixty seconds even though i did it i thought i was gonna die and so then when did the ninety seconds i was like oh i did it i did it i did it you know and i was just so excited and this happened week to week to week to week and you and then i finally made it through to week nine and was able to run for a full thirty minutes at a time and then i did my races um and was able to fun a full five k without stopping which was like the biggest high ever and you know the whole time that i was doing it doing my training i never did think about okay i wonder how many calories this is burning and oh my i did think a lot that it sucked because it's exercise but the whole time i was also thinking i can't believe i'm doing this i can't believe my body is capable of doing this and the whole time that i was doing it my body was changing and don't get me wrong i know that i wasn't a year out then and you know i was losing weight quicker which really wasn't that quick for me if you remember but maybe two pounds a week was really really good but anyway it was something i was excited about and it wasn't always about the scale because i was doing something else that was bigger something that was like more meaningful than watching the scale move and since then i've been exercising for the benefit of exercise and trying to make it that scale goes down you know what i mean and i've been focusing on the scale again and it's just not it's not fulfilling it's frustrating because the scale's not moving i'm over a year out you know it's kind of hard and so um you know i was thinking i want that passion i want that goal to you know to keep getting better and better and better and seeing progress and not talking losing sadness or watching the scale i'm talking about my body being able to do something that it never could do before because i was obese so anyway i found well i decided remember last year i was like oh my gosh oh my gosh i ran the gate river run five k that is it wasn't even the gate river run but it was on the day of the gate river run and its where the gate river run started it was a public quarter time junior and something run for charity or something like that but anyway the gate river run is a fifteen k and i said last year i'm doing that one next year which will be in march of two thousand and ten and you know i am i am able to run now i can't run fifteen k but there are i mean like jamie and tom there are people that are out there who used to be obese who are training for marathons and have marathons and you know what i am going to train also i found a website i'm gonna put it over in this way in the side it has all kinds of different programs to get you training for a race um even walking and it has different levels too so if you are just like wanting to train for a five k and you already can run a five k and you want to increase speed it's got training for that it's got all these different programs that you can do it's got beginners or novice intermediate and advanced and it's got walking jogging and running so if you can't run what's stopping you from being able to train for walking a five k i mean if you're only post op that's what you should be doing i mean a five k is three point one miles so that may sound like it's you know never gonna happen at this point but you know you start with a quarter of a mile and then you know you work up next week to do maybe half a mile and you keep going until you're able to walk the entire five k and the two races that i've been in they the back people all walked it so there's no reason why you can't make that a goal for yourself to be able to walk in a race and then maybe the next race you might run a little bit or jog or whatever and you know it's very very motivating and another thing that motivated me was actually going and registering for these races because i thought okay i've already paid for it it's usually about twenty bucks i've already paid for it so now i've really gotta train because i won't be able to do it once it comes so anyway i was excited very much so about that i have decided to start training for i don't know if i wanna start training for the half marathon or the eight k or the fifteen k it doesn't matter though the fifteen k isn't until march i wanna be well able to do it by then because i'm not gonna start i enjoy running um and i'm in florida i don't want running on the treadmill it's too monotonous and after like three minutes i think oh my god i'm not done yet oh besides i hate it i'm so bored but when i'm out in the neighborhood or on the streets or whatever you know i've got a matmorrun com and i you know map where i'm going it tells me how far it is and when i take off and you know it's motivating to be able to see scenery and feel the wind blow and the cars go buy and listen to those kinds of things and you know i have my ipod too and plus i make the kids come with me on their bicycles behind me so that one could carry my water and they can go go mum go and you know you're doing great and all that stuff so anyway we're gonna look at the time okay i've only got a couple of minutes i did go my one year post op this week and my doctor was just amazed he was like oh most people don't do as good as you did and you know that's just awesome i didn't go and tell him that i have the youtube support system and that i exercise more than the average patient because a lot of people really do believe that you can just um you know let their surgery do all the work and it can and i'm not gonna be that way i could tell i wanted to change my life i wanted to get active and so anyway i did tell him that i did two five k races and that you know i work hard but didn't go into detail that i am strength training that i go to the gym and that i'm you know exercising all the time so anyway that goes to show you guys if you incorporate exercise you're gonna do better than the average do i think it's sixty to eighty percent um weight loss excess weight that is and i've lost like eighty five so far and i'm still not done i asked him what my goal should be i'm one sixty now and he said that one forty and that's what i wanted to be remember guys so i've got twenty pounds to go but i'm not gonna focus on that i'm going to focus on training and that will change my body um and then what else am i gonna say oh he said i have about five more months that i will slowly lose and you know when i was busting my butt and everything i was only losing about four pounds a month anyway so i'm not expecting to lose anything really but if i do that's great i love my body i love being a five a you know the number on the scale is very frustrating and annoying but honestly the whole thing is the number that's frustrating me the number because i'm happy with the way i look it's the number that irritates me why i don't know because if i look this way and it was a hundred forty pounds i would be thrilled it's that freaking number that's got me obsessed so screw the number i'm gonna run and i hope you guys will start doing it with me i'm gonna put a link over on the five of for the gate river run it's the biggest fifteen k in the united states and it's for like the fifteen k championship

572,well i am so excited to talk to you today about goals strategy and tactics because i this is really the secret sauce first off the goal might sound like a no brainer but some people forget what it is to increase revenue hello we're in the business of making money that's what we're supposed to be doing here uh now a lot of people think of the strategy as being the goal the strategy i'm going to use is to increase audience that's a strategy to achieve that goal there are lots of other ways to do it some through you know hacking staff i mean that's one way to increase your revenue right spend less money on people i say increase the audience both on air and cross platform there are a lot of platforms that are available to us for free so let's utilize every tool in the arsenal we possibly can and by the way interactive audience because an interactive audience is much more likely to be salable to the clients and that's what we're looking for right there now a variety of tactics we're going to use i told you before i didn't really wanna let the cat out of the bag and all my different tactics but i'll give you a peek inside the bag you know what happens when a wild cat gets loose you heard about that right good all right well first off on air tactics uh first off make every break count i mean every break use cultural touchstones i mentioned in my morning show philosophy that there are assignments that are handed out to the various people on the show and that really that all that is is well what are you planning on doing today well i'm going to watch uh you know the world's biggest loser or whatever and so that person is in charge of watching that and coming up with two or three observations they can share with us on the air we can slot that into a thing maybe come up with a biggest loser bid or something like that but that's what that's all about cultural touchstones things that other people are going through maybe they're just going out to eat that night and that's their assignment go out to eat but observe and come in with some observations based on that um balancing the clock because of that now part of making every break count is making sure that you're hitting all the surface elements that you're hitting all the different uh information about the artists that you're doing the cultural touchstones that you've got something funny going on a little something for everybody in every quarter hour little mini shows within shows spiking the phones that's a big one that people neglect a lot of times well the phones aren't ringing well it works two ways call people give em a line have them feed it back to you now you've got interaction and there's something about success it feeds more success so you can do that stuff uh engaging the listeners on every level possible that might mean uh going out and talking to people on the street as well when you engage the listeners better interviews here's an idea for you interviews not just on the telephone or in studio but using uh g mail's video chat or just even audio chat online you set up an account for em a dummy account they can sign into that thing now you've got studio quality sound in your studio sounds like they're right there or pretty close to it sounds a whole lot better than a telephone it's not so fatiguing on the air much more interesting and the liners that you get whoo a whole lot better all right oh by the way no contest in the morning show they're games games are much more fun to listen to gosh i'm just barely scratching the surface on my on air stuff uh more on air stuff how about a window sticker campaign i always call them window stickers because a bumper sticker while that's down it's on the paint maybe and people don't like to do that and by the way when you're parked behind a car what do you see you see the window in front of you you don't see the bumper kay the window sticker is line of sight but uh it's labor intensive to get those on cars don't just put them in stores or hand them out to people at contests at remotes and things put them on cars register people to win a contest and do that for an extended period of time a sustained effort and you're going to see your stickers i promise you everywhere they will be more ubiquitous than uk stickers they really really will how about being an on street ambassador street level ambassadors when you're out doing stuff your personality is switched on baby you're doing stuff you're you're interacting with people in line at the grocery store talking about what's on the front page of the magazine maybe saying something funny or just making an observation maybe they recognize you maybe they don't but they're believe me by the end of the conversation they can engage listen to what they're saying interact with the community uh invited them to listen to the show or to even call in give em a card write the telephone number on there to the warm line and by the way a warm line is an important thing we can talk about in the future uh mos man on the street stuff you know i carry with me my little pocket recorder all the time here it is right here i take this out with me and i'm always ready to ask people questions and i can get a variety of em and then whenever it's uh time to put those in the computer i just uh pull this apart slide it in edit it up it takes no time at all and you've got a really cool bit now now you're ready to answer some telephone calls as people interact with the folks they heard on the street and by the way the people you talk to on the street i'm going to be on the radio tomorrow be sure to listen see that's how it works every event you do every appearance that you do every remote broadcast it's an event of some sort there's something extra going on it's not just we're selling cars down here at the car mart now there's something different going on in each one of em some reason other than a sale for them to come out uh it's fun to play the games in person to watch the games do things like i don't know pepsi bowling do the turkey hurl whatever it happens to be have a pie eating contest something that's fun for people to do something that's different that people will talk about that they'll come out to see that works for the client and it's more fun on the air than just we've got sale items uh who cares about your sale items frankly really other things you can do hire an entertainer hire a magician hire a guy that makes balloon animals or uh a singer a band whatever it is uh they'll a lot of times do that just for the mentions on the air tell em you'll you'll tease em for a week in advance and let them pass out cards at the event or pay em some nominal fee bucks whatever it is you know at the particular event they'll come out believe me they'll come out uh another thing you can do is have some sort of contest you have the pie eating contest get some local heavyweights maybe an anchor from another station or a politician who's uh wanting to you know kiss hands and shake babies excuse me shake hands and kiss babies and bring them out to the event should be a lot of fun um community involvement but careful strategic community involvement not overextending the station that's why i have the the two charity rule typically now you can do some other things especially like around christmas time when you have things like the toys for tots campaign that wouldn't count as a major campaign or anything but something you could actually do um by the way don't do politically divisive stuff by that i mean maybe something recycling as innocuous as it sounds strikes some people the wrong way strikes other people in a different way and it just has political connotations it didn't use to have that we don't need to have i devised a campaign i recycled i can't remember tons i think it was something like fifty tons of phone books in reno i got a commendation for doing that uh it was a big deal in nineteen ninety one recycling now smacks of uh too green for some people not green enough for others and so ain't no sense in going in that direction but you can raise money you can raise awareness actually make a difference in at least one charity exploit your tv connections by the way here's another thing you can do on the air when a celebrity is coming to town uh and they're going to be in the studio with you contact a tv station let em know that stuff okay oh and if they won't come then you set up a couple of cameras one trained on the celebrity one trained on the overall ark of what's going on in the control room you just cut back and forth between them take the sound off the air now you've got something you can put online that's gonna come in a later tip a little tidbit a little tactic that you can use when an event has great visuals tv stations and diane you know this um tv stations are always looking for something interesting something visual something exciting and different local that they can put on the air if you can provide that for them they'll love you and they'll put you on and everybody's friends um if they don't turn up then you can shoot the stuff yourself or have an intern shoot it or whatever and and have the visuals edit it for them and they're ready to go look for angles that benefit the tv viewer not that just benefit the tv station they're they uh producer's gonna wonder why should i put this on the air give them a reason tell them why it's important to their viewers and they'll want to do it invite uh the anchors or reporters on the air or just on the telephone interact with them talk with them laugh cut up show the man behind the curtain for them too they'll love doing that and it's good for both of you partner on a big charity event whether it's a food drive or whatever it is with a tv station with an anchor that kind of a thing find a way to get involved you get tv coverage out of it they get radio coverage out of it one hand washes the other everybody's happy i've only talked about tactics on the air still to come we have youtube tactics facebook tactics and twitter tactics i'm going to get to those in the next video i hope you'll watch those as well but here we go here we have our goal to raise revenue our strategy by increasing audience awareness and you can't just sit in the station anymore you have to touch people this is how it's done and the third thing is the tactics and we're getting right through that,,1994
573,hey guys it's been ages since i made a video which i apologize obviously but i have two very good reasons why number one school for i've been sitting in a classroom with a few other people with a man at the front or a woman talking at us and hoping something goes in that's basically what i've been doing for the past few weeks but now it's summer i've got more time recently as well keeping me out from making videos you know it's putting me into the outside world which i don't usually enter the weather it has been gorgeous it's been sunny what i really hate about is with the weather when it's raining and it's chucking it down which is ninety percent of the year everyone's complaining oh it's raining why isn't it sunny i hate this then when it's sunny oh it's too hot i'm boiling make it rain you know make up your mind the only problem with our heat waves is they only last for a few days i hate that you know we've got this forty degrees of sun beating down on us it's beautiful and then suddenly god realizes his mistake oh god i've made it sunny in britain so let's punish them with forty days of thunderous storm and that's what we had after the beautiful heat wave we had just rain and they chucked it down for it was like four months of rain in one day just because he'd realized that he'd played britain sunny for a few days really ticks me off so i guess school and sun have been keeping me away from the internet and outside not sure about that the only problem with the summer it does make you realize that there's nothing to do at home unless it's sunny you know you're stuck inside wondering what can i do i guarantee you'll all be bored at least once this summer i'll also guarantee you'll go to the cinema at least once and unfortunately you're probably go to see ice age in three d the great thing about that apart from the awful movie they give you free pair of glasses you know brilliant i'm giving my pair of glasses instead of keeping them in my pocket and they ended up being thrown away as i was bored one saturday morning i did a bit of um arts and crafts um and with a permanent marker and a pair of scissors i created my very own design with three d glasses here we go yeah you know i was bored so i thought why not i said i'm really sad at the moment i had nothing to do and the craze at the moment with what everyone is wearing and these wacky sunglasses you know that you got the bright yellow pink ones you know you got loads of them so i thought why not make my own okay you like it yeah i think that's gonna be my new look there you go,,510

575,guess why i'm wearing this hat besides the fact that it's really really cold out and this hat is pretty awesome because it is purple it matches my sweatshirt and my hair and my pants which you can't see through there whoo i'm wearing this hat because right now and almost every other second of my life um i have the ridiculous urge to pull out my hair this is a disease call trichotillomania and i have had it for about eleven years since fifth grade trichotillomania basically what i just said is a disease that causes people to compulsively pull out their hair yeah it sucks i've had to wear hats for like months and months and months on end because like i wouldn't have any hair and that's actually the reason that i shaved my head at the end of freshman year so my project for awesome video this year is in support of the trichotillomania learning center this is an online resource for children teens adults parents and families of those who have trichotillomania i remember that i was really really embarrassed to talk about my problems until i got to college and found a really really good support group of friends and in the harry potter community for adults it is not as hard to talk about because they have all ready come into their own as a person and they aren't as embarrassed to talk about stuff that bothers them but for kids especially adolescents oh my gosh can you imagine how difficult it would be if you were going bald and had to wear a hat to school every day and were embarrassed to tell your friends i know how it feels and the learning center offers support especially for adolescents and teens and young adults who are having lots of problems with trichotillomania i don't really have much more to say but if you want to learn more about trichotillomania or get involved or donate you can visit the link in the sidebar i hope this project for awesome day is wonderful for all of you guys and i hope you all find some new charities to support and i'm so excited that i get to do a project for awesome again because it is one of my favorite youtube videos of the year so yay project for awesome,,396
576,hey youtube i'd just like to tell you two things that bother me one is well i'll just give you a little introduction one day at sailing the somehow the subject of gays came up and bis and straights and this one little said i know somebody who's gay and she said it like it was like amazing and it was like she just like broke a world record and i'm like and i said oh aren't you special because i know many people who are gay well look i know many people who are gay and they have to cope through so many things and what i hate absolutely hate is how people say oh that's so gay or because they don't like the fact that someone's gay so they're like oh that's so gay instead of oh that's so shitty oh that's so crappy oh that's garbage oh i hate that say that because you have no idea what these people have to go through every single day okay i hope it's cool with you guys number two yeah i don't hate this as much because this is their self hate they they have to choose this they have to choose i can't tell them cause i'm not sure what i actually understand what it is i can't understand what these people are going through because if they want to cut themselves then they have to be going i can't they they have to be going through something way harder than i knew so i just like live life every day and i'm all like woo party but i can't understand what the thing that's going through these people's minds because they truly are troubled and i can't help them well i can but you and me we can help them so people who like cut themselves and self injure themselves i don't really know what to say cause i know many people who do that who cut and they're all like some of them are really close friends some of them aren't but like i know them and if you know someone then anyway it's like they're in here somewhere you just know them so don't just like blow them off and let go of stereotops sic types and be like oh they're so anal oh they cut themselves no they can't bear with life they can't cope with life and it is pretty hard if you ask me and you should know and you should you should know like there's there's there's many of you out there right now on the earth who can't deal with it so they feel that to escape from it they have to injure themselves so it's like relief i don't know if you know what i mean it feels good but it just like to know that i know someone out there right now or there is someone out there right now that can't cope with life that can't bear his life and they feel that they just wanna die and they their escape plan is to die it not only hurts them but they're affecting everybody around the world because one person's pain is another person's pain and so on it travels and echoes throughout the whole world and i just thought i'd like to make that point out to all of you who okay so peace out youtube oh comment comment and subscribe that'd be cool so peace i'll be seeing you guys later,,586
577,hey guys um so these past few days haven't been um the best um mainly because one of my friends he passed away on monday god i don't even know if i should be making this right now it's been pretty hard on all of us it was especially hard for me cause i mean i've never had anyone somewhat close to me die i talked to him the night before til like midnight or something and the funny thing was he just wouldn't stop complimenting me and and just he was just being so nice and i i just took everything for granted it's really hard because i never got to know him long enough you know i didn't have enough time to spend with him we had all these plans to do all these different things and we'll never get to do them you know what i mean and he was my age i mean it's way too young to die in a short span of life i think he lived it up as much as he could you know when i was talking to him the night before we made a plan to go on a date this weekend but i'll just i'll be going to his funeral instead he was going to go to fashion school he had he had such a future all he ever wanted to do was just see the nutcracker so it's been a tough couple few days and my friends and i are getting by by helping each other you know so i just wanna say to all his family and friends who happen to watch this um my prayers are with you and him anyways um i'm sad because he was just the nicest guy you'll ever know we'll all miss we'll all miss him a lot very much so yeah sorry if i don't make any videos anytime soon life is not going so well right now but we'll get by rest in peace and i promise next time i see you we'll go on our date and we'll go on our little photo adventure and all the things we planned to do i promise,,366
578,hello youtube it's here i just realized i haven't made like sort of proper talky video thing in a while well then like me and made some other ones so you can go on her account to watch that so i'm gonna put up mine but no it takes so long to load and basically uh yeah sorry about clown makeup by the way i was doing a thing for my friend's media so i was like i'm gonna put on lipstick and i'll be like the next colorful person or something and then it turned out that i was going to become so the whole like lipstick it didn't really work but i dunno but yeah so um basically i've i'm still alive and stuff and i'm making videos which is cool and um two things i wanted to chat about cause they are both serious matters okay first of all the galaxy adverts that you know galaxy chocolate all of those dumb adverts are just women like i love my chocolate i'm gonna eat a whole bar of it like every single woman it's like ever made i swear like correct me if i'm wrong maybe there's been one where a guy has been like i fucking love galaxy but most of them if not all of them are just these chicks like hiding their chocolate so other chicks can't steal it like the most recent one where these women like i love books and i love chocolate and it's like girls don't just eat chocolate like we're not just crazy onto chocolate sorry dodgy girls don't like weird fucking gonna be like yeah chocolate like i dunno it's just stupid fucking stereotype and it irritates me a little bit so it's just like i dunno maybe i'm just making a fuss over nothing but it's kinda like can we not with the whole constantly being chicks fucking eating chocolate on their own it's like we are not such bad people seriously also another thing i'll find it cause i don't remember the link my mate showed me then he was gonna show me something else and then he found that so he was like watch it but it's some guy called i dunno his mate was called cougarman but i think he was called big man but they did some version of um but the cougman guy had the right idea he was taking the call and saying like what the fuck is my mate doing i think it was on but big man guy he was like doing some version of lady gaga just dance but it's just basically him being like pull your pants down suck my dick mirror me i've got all my bitches and i'm going to change women now and it's like honey for real like just from what i've seen with the whole drug and he's not much of a looker it's like there's one bit where he's just like um uh bitch get all fumbled i'm gonna find another girl to suck my dick but it's like be happy with the one and you don't need to sing about it it's like congrats that you are getting some action yeah i'm i'm pleased for you and all that but don't kill lady gaga please her music is good i like it i don't want you to piss all over it with your crap pretty much like as bitchy as that sounds like i'm sure he's a lovely person in real life but like seriously don't put that crap on the internet no one wants to see it and rich coming from me cause i'm putting a video of me just talking on the internet but i'm not being unasked and i'm not killing a good song so just leave it but um yeah so that's two things that i found annoying and um anyone watching this who wants good music to listen to they should check out the millionaires they're pretty fierce wait i'll play a bit of them now actually wait finding it yeah so this is them and they're really awesome and um yeah i like them and you should listen to them cause they'e really cute and it's all pretty fierce but yeah i think that's about it and um i dunno that's about it also a big shout out to because she's fabulous and just because i've been talking to her and stuff and she's cute and um can't really think of anything else to talk about to be honest apart from that thing with the pope chatting about how condoms is increased the aids epidemic or something like don't know what he's all about like once again i'm have nothing against the pope himself it's just the second time something he said has been kind of silly to say the least but yeah pope needs to sort his things out cause now everyone's going to be like oh if condoms makes the whole getting aids chance higher i'm not going to use one then tons of people are gonna get aids all because of the pope so like yeah i don't know what he thinks he's doing and then some crazy bitch was on some show chatting about how condoms make aids worse as well and it's it's it's silly basically like yeah please get your facts straight before you chat about that kind of thing on tv and um hmm yeah i don't think i have anything else to talk about actually sorry this video me being like but i dunno um gonna stop fighting that yeah i think that's about it really yeah it's all happy youtubing guys i'll make a more interesting video next time love,,964
579,welcome to blog number cinco number five of here today to talk about my new glasses uh this is a topic that may not interest most people because it's not controversial um it's really not very interesting either so i don't know why it would interest anyone but this is what um our board of two panelists decided that i was gonna talk about so i just do what i'm told uh basically what just happened is i went back in time from two thousand nine to nineteen fifty six by putting these glasses on um back to the ages when men were men and boys grew up to become men unlike today when boys will be boys is the model of our society it was a proud time a time of coal mining hard hitting football players from places that mined coal uh the good old days i'm sure the green bay packers were good at football i don't know if vince lombardi was coaching but good times i really miss it not that i was there for them what else was happening oh um well we must've been in the middle of the cold war so that must've been kinda exciting um in our arms race with the russians and our race to get to the moon which happened um nineteen sixty four something like that i'm sure that was exciting and people with glasses just like these they designed those spaceships they designed the computer systems maybe neil armstrong even wore glasses like this when he said that's one small step for man one giant leap for mankind i don't know oh and by the way the moon landing was not fake that's just a bunch of mumbo jumbo i can't believe that people have the audacity to say that things like the lunar man landing and the holocaust are fake never happened that like especially the holocaust come on that's six million people six million people massacred or some atrocious amount like that and you're trying to tell them that it didn't happen when they still have relatives today that are alive unreal can you be any more insensitive to these people just make me sick and i wanna throw up all over this web camera right now and just show you how disgusted i am by the fact that you would take away this historic event which just hide the atrocities so that we don't have to think about the atrocities of mankind and what they committed i'm not saying that we should dwell on these but to forget about them completely is worse than simply sitting around and not doing anything because you're just gonna let it happen again um because people won't know about it and they'll just become as intolerant and abusive of power as adolf hitler was so as i was saying got new glasses hope you enjoy them as much as i do and uh continue to rock this is vlogging off,,502
580,hey guys it's friday the thirteenth and apparently friday the thirteenth isn't a bad omen this time um because just got something in the mail and it's from i knew she was sending it but like i was hoping it would get here um thursday but it didn't it just got here today so i'm gonna open it and i looked on the back and you probably can't read that but if you can uh the whole uh what would you do the is kinda like an inside joke between the two of us and it made me smile when i saw it i was like eeeh so i'm going to open it find out what is inside i know one of things but it it feels thicker than i thought it would be oh geez all kinds of little fun things in here that's the look of a confused person okay let's see oh she told me she was writing a little letter thank you you're adorable and i love you she got me a leakycon pen she told me about that oh you know what they were actually giving the ironically enough they were actually giving these booklets out to people um at leakycon two thousand and nine but now i have two oh that's so fun but wait that makes me smile and bill's cd aww i'm so excited bill is awesome ooh hello cd the little things inside broke that's sad that's why it popped out that's okay the case broke but the cd looks okay little piece of a case and bill signed it i say i wish you could've come soon scribble i'm pretty sure it says bill martin but it it it looks like a little scribble his his handwriting is a lot neater than hank's is though so bill wins on that front the case broke but the cd looks okay that's okay as long as the cd's okay that's really the most important part thank you for this that was really sweet of you you're awesome and i love you and i can't wait to listen to the cd and i have to find a good place for this pen i don't know where gotta go somewhere though cause i wanna be there aww that was really sweet of you thank you very much you're adorable thank you um i really appreciate it and i will talk to you soon but you know what the weird part is is the fact that the part that made me happiest was that it was from california and that touched it good times,,439
581,okay internet real quick we're gonna do a little cooking japanese lesson my mother was kind enough to send me one of my favorite pasta dishes and it is shells and real aged cheddar from the came from the states and so it's there and it's fine and i guess i'm gonna i'm gonna make it it's been in my um pantry for about two months and you know it's pasta though so it's fine so i made it here it is look at this oh yeah this is i put some uh some potatoes and some carrots yeah this is the good stuff but when i was cooking it i realized oh wait i need to mix some milk with the powdered cheese and uh yeah i need a quarter cup low fat milk see right there and uh it takes about eight to ten minutes to cook once it's at full boil so i was like eight to ten minutes seven eleven is only three minutes away i can do this so you know i go to seven eleven i buy the product of choice which i was hoping would be milk but instead i grabbed this guy this is another lesson in why i need to learn japanese completely it looks like milk doesn't it you got like white liquid pouring into glasses yeah it looks great so i buy it five hundred milliliters worth and i mix it with with the the cheese now the catch is that this is not milk this is like sweet something and here's here's what i make of it it says uh sheedoi which is white sheedoi oisheedsa which i am assuming is like white deliciousness or something along those lines new san king so new san king okay could be milk and then here in the yellow it says cream cheese cream cheese i did not bother to read that so i guess it's not the fact that i couldn't read but that i was in a hurry to get back here and so i didn't read and i just went by the pictures which is a bad choice so what i got was sweet cream cheese juice which you know is kind of good to drink you know it's not bad it sounds kind of nasty but it's all right so as a result i have instead of the average annie's shells and real aged cheddar i have sweet cream juice version of that and um you know i made a lot of it too ah it's all right it's it's kind of sweet it's got this kind of funky side to it you know funky is good so learn to read and be patient when trying to read peace,,462

583,ah hey guys so i'm glad to say that i'm home in las vegas nevada visiting for the weekend it feels awesome and this is my doggie lizzy yeah yeah lizzy she's named after me don't don't get it too wrong opp she cute opp she's bangs ah okay so let's catch you up on the dl there's there's not too much going on but i'm just excited to me home in vegas what are you doing i'm just so excited like i was driving home and i got here in like three hours cause i was speeding i was going like eighty five that is kind of dangerous in the dark but i'm about to go to lunch with uh some friends alex and harrison i'm excited to see them and then i'm getting a massage and then huh it's i should go to my dinner yeah she missed me i missed her it's been a long fricking time but anyways i'm happy to be home i just got to the chiropractor fixed my back because of all of my back problems and what not and then whoo she crazy crazy bananas but a i i need to make cooler blogs i don't know how to make blogs so if you want to help me out i've been like researching trying to figure out better ways to make them but i just like maybe i'm not that entertaining or something because i always thought that i was entertaining but then i look at other peoples and it's like they're twenty thousand times more entertaining and i got nothing that's why i only get like eighty views eighty that's like nothing you guys better watch my videos watch my videos and subscribe to that pointy box over there i think that's right over there and um yes so much stuff has been going on it's insane i am just awesome that's all i have got to say is that i'm just so awesome yeah so i'm talking to a guy that's all i'm going to say about that but he's pretty hot but this weekend is going to be a blast i'm probably going to blog but i just wanted to say how awesome it is to be home awesome awesome i say these words and i never stop saying them at all i want to show you guys my room pink there's a lot of pictures on my fitting bag over there yeah representing i've got to do homework this weekend not too exciting ahh you so i'm picking up my bike that's the main reason why i came down here so i could get up my bike and so i could go ride so if you're in la downtown and you ride a six gear call me because i need someone to ride with please all right i'm going to edit this and put it on youtube yeah i'm bored before lunch lahhh we'll see if you want my mouth don't you don't you loo l'loo l'looo you what are you looking at what are you looking at,,520
584,i'm talking like this cause this is for us to video i don't know what that is i don't know what to say think it's in the sidebar do you think we're going in the right direction the reason i'm supporting i'm not quite sure really if what they're doing i mean is a charity they're raising money they call for donations but i don't know if it's a charity what i'm supporting is the uniform project the woman who's doing the project dresses in the same dress every day for three hundred sixty five days with different things around it so in a way everything but the dress is an accessory even pants and tights everything is an accessory to that dress this is basically her every day with the same dress as her black dress i suck at this this is what i get for not being prepared yeah this is a model pose right there funds raised in the program go to the kontra foundation it's for the education of children in india so far they've raised enough money for one hundred eighteen kids to go to school if you donate in december ebay will match your donation up to fifteen thousand dollars for the dollar so if you donate one hundred and fifty five dollars i'm pretty sure i mean ebay is also gonna donate one hundred and fifty five dollars it's for a great cause kids definitely should go to school and raising money to help someone so they can go to school is just really fantastic because even though a lot of people are like ugh school well you probably have a lot more opportunities now that you have gone to school or that you are going to school and life is probably going to be a lot easier for you because you went to school just saying it's not a fact it's just an opinion but helping these kids go to school will help them be able to achieve more greatness in life and also decrease world's suck and hey who doesn't love decreasing the world's suck i mean add more awesome to this world and i think we're probably doing this wrong but that's basically it she um she look what i just found thing's monstrous so even if you don't donate just check it out,,394
585,so mr here got to experience old people driving for a day ah so yesterday i had to go to the grandfather and to go get a car and my grandpa was chauffeuring us chauffeuring chauffeuring us see i can't even focus i can't focus cha chauffeuring us to the uh little repair shop and uh so we're half way there and everything's going okay and i'm all proud of him that we haven't killed anyone we haven't run over any squirrels or dogs but he almost broke the mirror off he didn't even see that oh we're going an the the set up of the intersection is like there's a left hand turn lane that's going straight and a right and we're about fifty feet back okay so there's no left hand turn lane yet but my grandpa was like alright we're gonna make our own lane so he goes on the left of the cars going up so we're heading into oncoming traffic and there are these cars pulling out of like cvs and stuff and we're going up and whatever and i'm just like oh my gosh oh my god oh my god and there's this minivan that decides to do the same exact thing we did that's right in front of us so he starts to do that we stop then there's this other car wanting to cut in front of us it's an entire mess my grandfather's like ah what's going on yeah but you missed the fact that it was close we i mean that van pulled out like like a foot from i closed my eyes i closed my eyes i said holy shit we're gonna die this van was like it was close i mean he pulled out like a foot in front of us uh so uh yeah we we're squeezing on by and people are staring at us there was an suv that wanted to take a left in front of us and we were in their way and everything and we finally get in the actually right we actually get in the left hand turn lane finally and all of a sudden i love you okay then it's time like the light's changing and all these cars just blowing by us honking their horns and not just like ar ar no arrrrr arrrrr and the whole time the whole time grandpa's got his head down and like covered his face and every car it's like he can see in his face i actually heard him go oh my god and every car that goes by he's like thinking is that it finally and it's like one after another there had to be like five cars just and it's just like from the back of the car all the way past it they're on the horn each one of them every one like arrrrrrrr arrrrrrrr you know one after another with the horn and the oncoming cars were honking oh god ah and then the funniest thing is he just he just blows the whole thing off and we actually our plan was to go to mcdonald's to steal some internet and he goes oh we missed mcdonald's back there that was so awkward he'd go i'll turn around cos you were like no oh my god ahh yes so don't drive with old people unless you have your camera going i did have the camera with me but this all happened so fast that it was just like holy crap so we bo you almost lost two bloggers that day yeah we almost died well you'd have lived i think i think your grandpa and i we were on the one side yeah you guys were on the death side i was on the okay i'll live i'll crawl out the window uh oh that is horrible,,648

next week during my spring break but that is not what i wanted to talk about now it isn't a matter of fact i am doing word accents or about the fact that i am adjusting my laptop or about the fact that i moving so i can grab what i wanted to talk about what i wanted to talk about is this pocky but not the strawberry flavored pocky because i really don't like the strawberry flavored uh so um big thanks to kevin for eh running this part of my video because eh i want to use the original flavor of pocky for this but all i have left is my strawberry because he stole the last three pieces of it today so thanks i hate you and i really dislike the strawberry flavor so yeah i am just gonna sit here and eat my crappy strawberry flavored pocky wish i had some original flavored make me so mad sometimes uh i been now that i am done sulking uh so pocky if you don't know is it's kind of like a cookie in a way it's kind of like yeah it's like this this is a strawberry flavored pocky stick uh they come in packages like this you can actually buy them at like super walmarts i didn't know this until like yesterday they're not why did i say yesterday um i must be tired um it's last saturday because i had been looking for pocky like forever and i could never find it and the only place i i mean i spent three years looking for it and never found it until i went to a borders and uh they were selling it at this borders so i bought like a box along with uh where did it go this book i love this book uh it's full of little cats um just looking through here where my cheese burger where my pocky where's my original flavored pocky huh huh yeah you owe me a box mm i'm angry mm i'm going to look through here and then what am i doing i i'm doing a video not not i'm sorry i'm bored so i went to this borders and i bought that i can has cheezeburger book and um some original flavored pocky i bought one box of it and it was amazing and then it was like in january i think i spent months up this is like april it wasn't until like march i found some again and there was only like one box in borders i mean last time i was there they had like one of the by stands and they had like a bunch of it on there and then i went there and then i found this one box on a bottom shelf of in the monger section which made me kind of made me kind of ma ad i'm gonna talk in a weird accent like this for the rest of my video huh it's kind of like an australian accent in a way sounds really weird anyways enough of the accent um so i was kind of mad about that because i had been waiting months and months and months and months to get up to this borders again to buy some pocky and i only got the one box and they didn't have any more so i was like okay i'll just come some other time and get some and so i went to walmart and we're going down on the asian cuisi cuisi cuisine is that even a word cuisine cuisine yeah asian cuisine section and i looked down like oh my god is that why is there pocky here they had like one of those you know little box deals i don't know i can't really do it my webcam doesn't let me do that kind of stuff uh it was like one of those little box sleigh deals and it was full of pocky i'm like oh my god so i bought like a bunch of po a few boxes of the original flavor so i had like four of the original and i got one box of strawberry i really don't like the strawberry that well it takes like a cross between strawberry yogurt and strawberry ice cream it's not that i don't mind strawberry ice cream it just doesn't taste good when it's on pocky so i was kind of like mad today when i lost the last three pieces of my pocky so now i gotta buy some more original flavor and i was looking up on wikipedia and they actually have some really weird flavors which is like uh honey grape um tangerine five fusion berry whatever that is banana coffee caramel marble royal milk tea whatever that is melon milk honey and mi what uh why is oh honey and milk i was gonna say uh cream cheese berry sweet potato crush which is like crunchy cracker pieces in the chocolate pineapple pumpkin hazelnut um soy bean flour brazilian pudding blueberry and green tea those

587,hello everyone and welcome to wednesday thursday hello everybody and welcome to thursday so this is uh see it it's getting a little better it it's looking real good before it was just like it was fat but it looks good now and my name is uh has become a lot more of a conversational piece because people actually look at it now uh because before when i said my name it was just like i said it and nobody really asked me any questions cause it wasn't on the table sort of thing so now everyone of my the tables asks me the question oh is that i'm like sometimes i just just say yeah if i'm my name is it's doesn't matter got rid of this desk in my room so my room is bigger now and now i have just one big desk oh yeah my room is bigger now because i have a small room to begin with i began to notice recently that i've been contracting a an obsession to ties as um i bought five more ties they just look so cool but it's the only part of my uniform that's different than everybody else's and i like to have like having a good amount of ties i finally conjured enough money to go and buy farm worker two i'm gonna go do that as soon as i'm done making this video um because i had to return it four days ago and now i'm having withdrawal from the video game so i need to go make a purchase today is the sixteenth of december which leaves only nine days before christmas and um i was thinking should not buy people things for christmas they should just buy people gift cards or things or just give people money because the value of your money is ten times better after christmas anyways so what's the point of spending more before just like two or three days you just might as well wait so i went to work the other day and there's like two forty year old women and their two sixteen year old sons and both of the women were drunk they had just been drinking wine since they they were on the wait to be sat at a table they're sitting at the bar drinking and then when they got to my table they'd had don't you love just finding things in your mouth like they're uh they're drinking their wine and um do you all do you all like nuts because i wasn't going to talk about the desert but nuts isn't like nuts the lady goes well are you talking about the nuts on the food and i was just like did this lady really just say this to me and her sixteen year old son is like mom that is so inappropriate and then i said that's what i was thinking but then i proceeded to telling her that i thought it was funny that she had said that because it was really off the wall i was not expecting her to make a joke about my nuts but that shows people for you when they're drunk on that note i'm going to see you all later maybe this week if i decide to make a video um bye,,559
588,that's the reason why do i try to speak out girl like no know one could hear me i want to belong here but something is still so wrong here hello youtube oh boy has a lot has happened since i made my last video if you follow my videos you all ready by now be able to tell that this is another background then the one i've usually got in my videos and there's one very simple reason to that i moved grew up in a small town and when the rain would fall down i'd just stair out my window dream what love could til i touch the sky make a wish take a chance make a change and break away right that was a little montage of clips and photos that i took while we were moving and i just really wanted to use that song as a background because i think it's quite fitting anyway i'm here now and i officially don't live at home anymore i left lemme the second biggest city of denmark and i live here with my sister the wonderful marie and i would give you a tour of our apartment but there's still some moving mess around i've got box down there and the kitchen still need some work and marie's room isn't done at all so that will have to wait and the reason behind my move is that i'm going to start attending university in september and in denmark you start university on september the first and you get your acceptance letter from the university on july the thirteenth so yeah that means that today i got my acceptance letter this is the letter and if you don't understand danish then here it says and that means i'm accepted to university so as of september the first i'm going to be studying political science yeah i know that some may think that that sounds boring but i'm really hope that it isn't because that was my favorite subject in high school and so yeah all right so i have covered my move and my acceptance letter but those two are the only new things that has happened in my life i also got a job and actually i wasn't planning on getting a job at all but then my sister in law has a sister in law i know that sounds silly and she recommended me for a cleaning job at a hospital that's just near by so i couldn't really say no because it pays pretty okay and it's only every third weekend and i could use the money moving acceptance letter getting a job i got a fourth thing too i got a niece and i haven't seen her yet but i'm going to tomorrow and i have only seen a little picture of her and that i have got on my cell phone and yay now i have got two nephews and one niece and i think that it's just perfect so as you can understand my life has been eventful these past days and yeah i think i'm happy oh as a fifth thing that has happened i have cut my bangs i've got a bad habit of cutting my own hair and it just ends up looking ridiculous so i don't like my hair right now but i have time to cut it before school starts,,572

am back to six hundred sixty six so i want to talk about swine flu an epidemic that is just all over the country people are dying left and right the mexican baby died you know i know it is not super huge in the media the newspapers and everything like it was maybe two weeks ago but i didn't make a video two weeks ago so today is two weeks ago well just in case you might think that you have swine flu i am going to put a link in the sidebar i'm don't know which way it is a link in the sidebar that you can click on and see if you have swine flu this has concerned me ever since i was a child um would somebody please tell me if they have a tongue like i do that only looked incredibly retarded but uh yeah i have like a little crease in it and it and i don't know why so the new star trek movie came out like what two weeks ago a week and a-half ago i have seen four times more importantly the movie is incredible and if you haven't seen it you should go see it it is really really good olson he's the one who goes down to blow up the thing sorry if i am spoiling it anyway he has the red shirt he dies i thought that it was really cool that they put that in there most of the comments that i get on my videos are really you know favorable and then i get some bad ones but comments i read all of them by the way um comments that i get that are like i can't believe that you don't have a boyfriend and the blah b blah b blah b blah it's because i want a girlfriend i'm kidding no it's my personality that i have tried my entire life and i'm in a wheelchair to be caller number nine or six or one through eighty but i never get anywhere i finally won tickets and guess what i won tickets to the beard and mustache world championship i think that i am going to die alone with cats and a bunch of you are too so don't feel bad for me everybody loves a cat i'll still go i don't even care i'll go so yeah there's hope for you so go out there and find someone and if that person you have to gag and just throw into your van and to get you know what things have to be done you have to take chances in like criminal record sort of chances another trend that is no longer a trend but since i haven't made a video i'll talk about it is whatever her name is large lady using things very well britain's got talent i don't care i am sick to death listening to people say oh oh she can sing so well blah b blah b blah but really just because she is ugly we are suddenly going to talk about her i mean come on ugly people have skills too you know if anything we're demeaning her by saying she shouldn't be able to sing because she's ugly it is a horrible stare i mean if we say that we might as well say oh she can walk i didn't know that ugly people can walk did that girl just graduate high school she's ugly i didn't know that ugly people knew anything in fact let's broaden that any reality show period i don't care about they are people in fact i see repeat people people who would be on one reality show and then would be on another reality show that is completely unconnected these people are probably just actors that are trying to get their name out there and here they are acting like they are human beings actors are not human beings look at tom cruise some kids at school have been giving me crap about having a youtube account and they are probably watching this get reese who ever else anyway they say everybody who watches me is a total perv and i would like to disagree only like seventy eight percent of them are total pervs so what is that seventy eight so twnety twenty two percent are you know nice people and i bet all of that twenty two percent is watching right now and i bet that seventy eight percent is just unsubscribing or staring at my chest i don't know i don't know but it's happening right now another little weird thing is that i won tickets on the radio you call in and you win things i have tried my entire life to call in and be caller number nine or six or one eighty but i never get it well i finally won tickets and guess what i won tickets to the beard and mustache world championship i'll still go i don't even care i'll go,,1051
590,the fuck how i uch i look orange i do not wash to be orange thank you magic computer i do not want to be orange how do i change the fucking whatever technology is such a fucking nuisance i hate it i don't want to be fucking orange oh damn you i look if i may say so oh look at my lovely nails lovely nails um i'm going out for the first time like in a million fucking years um so um i'm going to try and bring my camera along not forget and like possibly you shall all be invited to come with me possibly possibly we shall see we shall see um so there's no light but that's okay um whatever whatever so basically i didn't make a video yesterday cause i was like fuck this and nothing's really going on lately which is kind of awesome um honestly this i'm loving this whole like how there's like no structure anymore this is what i've always um seen for this channel i never really was so big on the whole five awesome trys five days one day for each person and one post on their day and so much blah la la i think i'd rather just post when feel like it and when they actually have things to say cause otherwise you just get a people sitting there with nothing to talk about or people who just don't post yes i would never obviously do such things but other people might possibly maybe um you like my rings i bought i bought th this one when i was in new york i quite enjoy the lady lovely rose ring this one was two dollars and it turns my finger green which is lovely lovely yeah i like okay i'm going to stop my post pimping myself out on the internet um i'm really upset that i'm orange though okay so i just spent two minutes talking about what might upset my friends um whatever there's nothing to talk about um yeah i basically like i'm about to go out and i just like was like well i'll use my video so i'm going to turn on the camera and and have a uh extreme consciousness as it were um i'm really enjoying all of these massive massive massive long videos um yeah lady rosie and and jonathan i was quite amused quite quite amused by your sort of slow decline into nonsensical myth well no you made sense it was just more like i mean it's just got very creative or something it was kind of cool to watch like like have it documented um and such yes as someone who doesn't really drink or smoke or do anything like that but um yeah so yeah this is basically the most fascinating three minutes of your life don't fucking even lie about it um oh so new york that's what i should talk about so yeah um uch strange strange times strange times seeing my family again for like ages oh fuck there goes my thing kind of weird um but like what the hell i got a free trip to new york so that's good um can you see a little no you can't it's so hard to tell when you're doing make up like what's going to look really really subtle even when it looks really glaring and dramatic when you're this far away from the mirror and you're doing it to yourself yes and so um i have like a little glitter eye liner that's what i was talking about so whatever um yeah ew i look so fat what the fuck oof maybe it's my hair i need to cut it oh my god stop fucking talking about your fucking appearance gee whiz i'm pissing myself off um oh yeah so i was um kind of um i'm i'm very bad at documenting things i'm one of those irritating people who brings a camera and then doesn't turn it on ever so i i want really wanted to make a video with my sister when i was in new york but i didn't end up doing it um partly because i just was preoccupied with other things that was going on and partly cause like she doesn't even know what channel so i'm kind of like um yeah i told one friend about it like a couple months in and then like she stopped watching it a while ago i was like oh great thanks so yeah apparently um assuming she doesn't watch it then nobody knows about anymore which i like otherwise i'd feel kind of like censored and weird yes um i'm sorry i'm just like really obsessed with this like silvery pearl colored nail polish i think it's really really pretty yes quite enjoys it um wow i'm in a conceited mood apparently apparently apparently um so um yeah um so yeah anyway so i i like have a couple i might try to throw some stuff together from new york but i didn't really record anything i have a couple pictures also a picture of my sister like her um her her graduation um and that's about all i had so i don't really have anything for you guys i'm sorry sorry sorry sorry well obviously it wasn't a very exciting trip it was basically like weirdness basically i just wanted to see my sister again and kind of reconnect with her cause like she's really the only person in my family that has still any kind of contact with and i was kind of like not really if i need to cut you out of my life so that's fine but i just need to like know if that's what's going on or if i should still like wait for you or whatever cause it was just all very confusing she graduates high school this year it's a very kind of schmaltish time i suppose so i'm just going hang around and see like what she's going to do shop and lovely sorts of things it's all a bit up in the air but um yeah it's kind of a she might come out come out east to somewhere near where i am but she's staying in vancouver apparently um but that's fine um yeah family actually devil you deffers ouch um yeah oh it was my birthday too wait i don't think i want to say that but apparently i just did so it was my birthday on the second which was tuesday i believe tuesday um i did very very little as little as possible it was my roommate's birthday the day before and so i was like drinking with them and i don't really do partying two days in a row which is good so i done with drinking kay this

591,hey guys it's i know it's been a while since i updated i'm sorry i have just been so so busy um i think i mentioned in my last post that my company is going through a system conversion and that's been not a nightmare but just just extremely busy i'm working twelve hour days and it's been um it's been torture but i've been making it through um this year my daughter also started high school so i've been very busy um with her as well but everything's going good you know um let's see as far as my update you just say me weighing myself in so as of today september thirteenth i weigh two seventy one um so that's a total of forty four pounds lost um i'm extremely happy with that um september ninth i celebrated my three months um since getting the on june ninth and so that's forty four pounds in three months so that's pretty good and i'm happy with that um let's see as far as what size i wear i was wearing a twenty four now i'm a solid twenty but i i am getting into some eighteens um depends on where i buy em from ashley stuart i could wear an eighteen lean brown i can an eighteen entorit i still wear a twenty i'm still pretty top heavy i'm still pretty wide across here so i'm still wearing an eighteen twenty um you know twenty shirts up here but my bottoms are getting um are getting smaller so um i need to really start focusing on upper body exercises i do a lot of cardio but the cardio is really working on my lower body so um need to concentrate on that anyway um i got my second fill on september fourth and now i have good restriction i uh let's see i have fourteen cc van and on my first fill i got three ccs put in and it didn't give me much restriction so i noticed that kind of right away as soon as i started eating solid food so i made an appointment to get another fill and that fill happened on sep four so um he added two ccs and so that made a total of five and i actually felt it tightening up it felt like a little mild stinging heartburn and i was like wow i didn't feel the first one this is weird you know um so i went out to the waiting room and started sipping on some water and got a lot of pressure in my chest and a lot of hiccups i mean it was terrible all for a sip of water so i knew it was too tight and um it's funny because i actually knew it was too tight based off what i've heard people here on youtube and on um the obesity help board mention how you feel when you're too tight and so i knew right away and um i told them hey it's too tight you gotta take some out so he took out one cc so it's funny because three ccs didn't do anything for me and five was too much so now i have four ccs and it's perfect restriction um and because i have good restriction now i'm really concentrating on only eating good stuff because since my portion size has um significantly decreased i can only um take in so much i have to make sure that those are good foods for me so this last week and a half since i got my fill pretty much only meats and vegetables and i do like a grilled chicken pattie maybe half of that and um uh maybe a fourth of a cup of vegetables and i'm good um it's funny though because what i have to do um i'm sorry go back to that chicken and vegetables and that's it i don't eat any kind of carbs no pasta no rice no sugars um i do eat some fruits but that is pretty much about it i don't have time for anything else if i get in the mood to eat something it's gonna have to be you know a piece of lunch meat or something like that something that's gonna give me some kind of vitamin or some kind of protein i don't waste my time with anything else um i'm still working on drinking my calories though because i do drink a lot of teas and lemonades and things like that and i need to get rid of that um one thing i have noticed though that i need to get my brain to start appreciating let's say is the fact that the full sensation you get with the lap band is not necessary a satisfying full feeling um before when you had hunger and you would eat something you weren't hungry anymore it was a satisfying okay finally i ate i'm good the lap band it's kind of just a red light or indicator that you need to stop eating because it fills you up it fills that pouch and if you eat anymore you're gonna have a lot of pain so it's kind of like one of those like i said stoplights but it's not a satisfying like pleasurable feeling it's kind of uncomfortable not extremely painful but just a little uncomfortable so um before you eat too much to get it painful like i said just stop and push away from the plate um so because i know that the weight is coming and the lap band is actually working for me i'm trying to get my mind to appreciate that feeling and not search for that satisfying you know bottom of the stomach you know feeling uh my head hunger is getting better um i don't graze but um when i do feel the need to want to munch on something i will grab um some fruit or a little thing of apple sauce or some sugar free jello or something like that um i just don't grab the bad stuff anymore um i do baby bell little cheeses and stuff like that that tends to help again anything that has protein in it i'll go ahead and do it um let's see i mentioned that i was an size twenty size eighteen so i'm gonna back up and let you see my new size eighteen skinny leg jeans in a second but before i do that i want to tell you guys um i think i showed in an early early video um the special k protein water the little bottles they now have the little mix in packets and you get ten packets in here for the same price of getting i think four or six pre made bottles so it's better cost savings um for this and they're really cool um so i actually hadn't had the pink lemonade i think i may try it tonight um but yeah they're pretty good got it at walmart so um yeah there you go anyway so that's the gist of my update i'm gonna back up now so you can see new in my new jeans and um you guys take care of yourself i'll talk to y'all later,,1226
592,hey there you see i get haunted and a certain thing was stopping my door from opening and i thought i would never get into the house but it's all like it hit and it went dunk and it hit hit something that was blocking it between the wall third doubt the package included this t shirt i'm wearing oh yeah this machine pose news and this cd by hank green hoh hoh square and nerdy just how we like it the cd is was in my computer hank green the song this isn't hogwarts somewhere out go fish i know mules are so half ass protons and neutrons dead boys girlfriend demolition derby fathers of the family fathers jesus gets nothing for christmas vegetables and it all makes senses in the end as well as a t shirt i preordered i got signed pick yeah tha tha tha that is one hundred percent hank's signature yeah it can go with my other pick in fact i am going to introduce my picks as friends now you know i love it i have seemed to miss placed my wallet and it must have contained my pick ah ah wallet and spoon all right okay introducing picks into a new habitat do do do do do offspring pick meet hank pick hank pick offspring pick like each other i now have a total of three picks one of them i seem to can't find eh ha yeah i mean yeah it's hank's signed i mean tha tha that's like hank green's his signature right there and last but certainly not least why am i speaking russian or russian accent anyway whatever we have a oh no wait that's how i say it we have a haaaa poster of hank with shark eyed jones art on the back along with lyrics well you know i've been doing a lot of magic tricks recently i want to try one with you guys so see look you know it's a hank poster a hank poster i mean i have i have hank on my wall now right well on a slightly sadder note i'm leaving youtube not permanently don't worry just this channel but i want to do this is going to be my last video on this channel and then i'm i'm going to make a new channel cause of all the haters this channel it could get watched it could get commented i'm going to put all of them to my spam e mail address so i will never know this channel is going to sit here and die while a new channel will rise up i will continue in the xxx i'm still going to be a i'm still part of that i'm still going to do everything with and and and and and everyone i'm just going under a new name cause i'm sick of the haters because i'm allowed to have and opinion i'm still a person i maybe only but that still makes me a legal person i might not be and adult still i say person so you know for all the people that matter i'm going tell you my new channel most of them i'll see you at school but you know i've got ah if you want my new channel just hear me i i'll still be using this one for another two weeks for that kind of stuff but most of the people i'm just going to send it out to my subscribers and uh my friends people at school people who watch me you know i'm not going to put any links to my new channel in this one because all of the haters will just swing to there i'm just sick of it i'm just sick of the haters i mean so what if i write on twilight i don't like it although i'm going to see the film the new one because i don't want people to say ah stop judging it before you've seen it i'm going to see it and then i'm going to judge it okay i'm going to see it so you know it this is the end is dead as of this moment,,707
593,hey everybody so um pardon my appearance right now it is actually freezing freezing freezing on top of freezing i don't know if there's a cold front coming in or something like that but it is cold so i've decided to be safe and to wrap myself up kinda like a burrito type thing and not come out unless absolutely necessary but oh sorry adjust my my burrito um i just received another comment and i know i had made videos about this a long time ago but i guess it's best to do it again since i don't know when i'll be able to reload those videos and it's about dating in japan and of course dating in any country is something that can be complex or i don't know into it especially a lot of young ladies that would like to come to japan and would like to date i mean that's understandable you're in a new country why not but um one of the questions that came up that was sent to me yesterday was talking about the difference between japanese men and western men and whether i've dated a japanese guy before and what did i notice in differences when dating japanese men and i can't really answer that question i've only dated one japanese guy and that didn't work out and it was more personality differences than anything else and so that that happens with anyone but from the women that i know that do date japanese men and have been here a lot and very very clear about the differences between japanese men and western men is affection and i know in animes and in dramas and things like that you see you see an overwhelming amount of affection and you're like oh it's so cool it's so dreamy da da da da da but regular japanese guys aren't really like that and for a japanese guy that i do know just talking about basic like complimenting their girlfriends doesn't happen very often um but with younger people now you'll see them holding hands and things like that where you wouldn't see that before so society is changing in that way when it comes to affection but that's something that's been very clear even when i dated um a japanese guy it was not as common to be complimented by him or to have you know that kind of affection to be hugged to be um admired and things like that and i'm not saying that japanese men don't do it i'm not and even older women that i've talked to in my office especially um because bobby has come and he's visited and he is just a really friendly and affectionate guy and i remember one day i was talking to my co worker and i was like bobby called me a full time job he said he has two full time jobs me and his nine to five and so i was i was laughing to myself and then one of my co workers had said she wishes that her husband would say stuff like that because japanese men don't usually compliment uh japanese women um whether it be their style or their character or things like that it's just not as common a thing and for the women that she knows that date american men or european men or men from just other places in general uh she said that it's just not as common and she wishes that her husband would would say things like that but then she wouldn't know how to react because she's so accustomed to not hearing those kinds of things and um not to discourage anyone because you date who you want to but finding um a boyfriend or girlfriend actually no let me say a boyfriend because it's i've noticed that it's a lot easier for guys to find a girlfriend a japanese girlfriend than it is for girls to find a japanese boyfriend but it is what it is and it depends on where you are it depends on what your personality is like but don't be discouraged if you'd like to date while you're here by all means i encourage you to go out there and watch go places and watch how they interact with each other because that will tell you a lot about what exactly it is you're up against and on top of that you have to figure out what exactly you want before you go dating anybody because if you don't know what you want then you're liable to fall for the okeydoke and you don't want to do that anywhere in life anywhere it doesn't matter where you are so figure out what you want what you don't want and just watch it may take a long time to find someone but you never know you might come across the love of your life or you might come across an experience that you know sets you up to find whoever it is that you're looking for later on so yeah i am reporting from under the the covers and i bought a heated blanket so i'm not freezing and i'm about to cover my head up and go to bed so i go to bed it's a little early what is it it's not even five o'clock yet but it's cold and i'm getting back under the covers so i will see you all later,,918
594,this is sunday the twenty first of december yes and i'm really sorry i haven't been away around for a really long time i really don't have any decent excuse for not being so other than that i've had a lot what to do i don't anymore because it's my christmas holidays which is lovely and my teacher has been clipping me in because some of us are doing retakes next year just in january so they're giving us some time to do all our revision and we're taking one english exam on pride and prejudice from last year and i'm doing a new english exam on the rape of the lock and she stoops to conquer so i'm doing a lot of revision for that and i've got one essay to do so it's not that much which is nice um i briefly mentioned in my video yesterday that i received two investee offers one from sussex and one from kent sussex i didn't expect them to want three a's for definite especially since i'm not predicting three a's and um but i'm not too bothered because i didn't really want to go to sussex so um yeah not that bothered by it but i did get an offer from kent and they want only three hundred and twenty points which is the equivalent of an a and two b's and they didn't want any in english which is i think might be doable which is quite encouraging the only problem would be that if i don't receive any more offers um well i'd have to put sussex as my first choice because you shouldn't have a second choice which one's higher grades than your first your insurance choice should always be lower so it all can get quite confusing but um hopefully i'll hear back from some other universities fairly soon that would be nice but i don't expect it as it's the christmas holidays now speaking of which i haven't been feeling that christmassy i'm beginning to feel more so now cause i keep hearing christmas music and i think not hearing it for a few days has been a nice break and is actually giving me a lot of christmas spirit and um i did briefly go to buthland abbey with my family today very briefly but this is the very lovely barn with the huge christmas tree i really don't have very much else to say today so you should see me on friday which is the day after christmas day happy christmas everyone,,429
595,hey guys it's um i know i say this in like every video but i apologize for my appearance um my hair looks like a hot mess i just realized that yeah um i was just gonna say like my appearance because i'm not wearing makeup but apparently my hair looks disgusting too um i'm getting well my mom cuts my hair cause she's fabulous um so she's chopping off like two or three inches tomorrow because as you could see it's at a very awkward length and i can't really do much with it because usually when it's like shorter i can scrunch it in there's this like fabulous wave thing and it's like woah tototo or if i sleep on it wet it like curls and stuff yeah anyways so i kind of like straightened it last night and then slept on it and my hair looks like so terrible anyways um whenever i'm not wearing makeup i just have on moisturizer which is why my skin looks kind of dull i didn't put on concealer or anything i'm not putting concealer or all this stuff whatever um i don't have one like micro mineral foundation so um that's like kind of like weird um just wanted to kind of update you guys on some stuff though first of all in case you didn't know i'm having a contest so you should go enter it um i don't have the prizes yet but well i have some of them but i want to make a video when i have every single prize um what else yeah like i'm gonna make a video when i have all the prizes that's why i think that's why i only have like one entry so far thank you for entering by the way and thank you in advance to all the people who do enter because usually like with my last one i only had like a couple entries and then when i started showing prizes i would start getting more entries and i had like over thirty entries with one hundred subscribers so i was like okay how ya doing so um yeah pretty much i um still have to go get it just because i was focusing all my money on getting christmas presents for my family and stuff so um i'll have more money after christmas when i start babysitting again and stuff cause i babysit for this family like on a regular basis and they said they're gonna need me like a week after christmas so like next week so they're like yeah we're gonna need you like a week after christmas they didn't know the exact date but they knew that they're gonna need me so yeah i'll have money and then i'll go out and um buy prizes for the contest hey um it is really like mostly drug store stuff i'm not gonna go out and be like so i bought like twelve mineralized skin finishes and five thousand mac blushes and stuff because i don't have that kind of money i am a seventeen year old girl with like well not that being a girl has anything to do with it whatever i am a seventeen year old who does not have a job because i am focusing on school my job is like babysitting and then i'm opening up my etsy soon now that i can actually sew again because i can use my thumb so um i actually went to the craft store today and with my mother and got some sewing machine needles five so that's plenty of um needles fixed up and then i got some colored feathers with like spots on them and you can't even see them in here they just look really dull but i'll open them up and show you guys one of them hi i'm sure that's sanitary everybody wants to buy them now um i'll show you one of them hey here's what i could make since i'm gonna be a hot guy next year oh oh that's when i'd really like apathetic whatever so it's like they have like these awesome like feathers polka dot things so i'm gonna be putting them onto like clips and headbands and stuff and he was like oh my god like me rocking my page whatever my stuff whatever anyways so like me rocking pages the cute little tiny tiny feather um so i will make um another video when i actually have stuff up on my etsy telling you guys to go check it out but this is like a pre cursor kinda thing to what i do make i sew so um i'm gonna have like bags and like whatever on there i might make some like wallet type things like pouches and stuff i got some vintage um zippers at a local thrift store like i got a bunch of them so i don't know what i'm doing with them yet i was thinking about making clothes because i do know how to sew and like i have sewn my own clothes before and stuff but it's just so hard with like the sizes cause then it's like if i make it and it doesn't sell because it's not the right size and somebody's like oh you know that's like a size to small or a size to big on me and i'm just like well that sucks because it's one of a kind you know what i mean so although i do alter my own clothes and stuff um i'm not gonna do it on there just because it's harder to do that but um and i also wanna start doing an installation of at sea like sites like i know how kaye does her like beauty hairs you should check out um that's kaleen's creation i'll put her link in the sidebar too cause she's fabulous um even though most of you probably already know who she is um but if you have an at sea site send me an email and i'll check it out um because i do want to start like send me a private message on here um i do want to start kind of showcasing it just to give you a hint though most of the at sea sites i will be promoting will be like really bright colorful vivid ones that are like oh my gosh you can tell we took time and effort to make our product not like here i put some beads on a string give me twenty dollars now like different if they're like real like legit stuff cause there are some stuff like that but when you hint sometimes i've looked at at seas sites and like you some people messages and they're like hey check out my shop and i'm like oh you're stuff's sucks but i don't say that because that would be rude so um yeah not that my stuff's like the most amazing stuff in the world but yeah i'm just kinda like okay can you like put a little effort into your products like at sea is supposed to be stuff made with love not just for like the money so yeah i'm gonna do that and then i knit so i'll be having hats and wrist warmers and scarves and stuff um not as many of those as like sewing stuff and like stuff i can glue and what not because that does take longer i'm gonna be having wrist cuffs which are really awesome and their kind of like if you're like me you'll wear them on a daily basis but some people might just wear them if they're like going to like a costumey party or something but if you're like me you'll just wear them because you're fabulous um i have a lot of accessories like hair bows and like hair stuff uh like headbands and what not and clips um i'm trying to think of what else bracelets necklaces earrings i have all the stuff to make it already a lot of stuff with buttons oh my god stuff with buttons i just love okay that was really creepy sounding anyways so i'll have like a lot of stuff like that um i'm trying to think of what else cause i do like a lot of stuff with like charms and what not and like sewing and buttons and feathers and my stuff is very very colorful the stuff i make so if you're like into color you'll probably like it like if you like spotted feathers on headbands and clips you'll probably

597,british insurance company willis group holdings recently leased one hundred thousand square feet of my city's icon the sears tower as part of this deal the tower is being renamed willis tower the renaming of the sears tower already has a lot of chicagoans protesting saying what you talking bout no really they are actually saying that search youtube but here in chicago we protest lots of important things in the past say eighteen eighty six we protested thing like unfair labor practices in order to bring about progress and as time went buy we started protesting things to preserve our history like when chicagoans protested the renaming of a department store in two thousand and six and again in two thousand and seven and again in two thousand and eight speaking of history historically some of our protests lead to the eight hour work day and the abolishment of child labor no wonder there is so much unemployment no kids working now all too often our protests seem to lead nowhere history is important but without change it's not really history and in this case i like to think of that historical quote i think it was shakespeare that said what's in a name that which we call a rose by any other name is still a big ass building named after a corporation or something like that besides it could have been worse hi i'm martin blow with blow management i'd like to buy some skyscrapers,,248
598,hey guys i know it's been a while i've started uni and everything and a lot of stuff has been happening i've been moving back to my house and everything that's why i haven't made any videos and yeah i thought i'd do some videos today as seeing i have time and everything i'm off uni for a day and um yeah so i thought i'd do my september favorites as you can probably tell from the title well before i start i dyed my hair and got it cut um i got it darker it used to be really light like reddish blond now it's more of a chocolaty blond like a darker one if you can tell it's completely different um i'll do a before and after picture of what it was like and i'll probably be in my blog and i'll put the link in the side bar and yeah so the before picture's gonna be a picture from e so if you want to see that as well you guys can and yeah so i thought i'd do my september favorites and the first thing i want to pick are my two favorite brushes of the month which were my all time favorite brushes this one was like my before i started buying my own makeup i started using this brush a lot it was like my only brush which is the cosmopolitan and blusher brush star cause i normally used sponges for my foundation and the sponges that you get with the eye shadows and that was like the only things i used to use and that was my only brush at that time and yeah i really like this brush because it's really affordable and it's like five pounds or something in superdrug and it's really soft for a drugstore brush i haven't bought any like any other drugstore brushes like as far as i know and i happen to be in milly and number seven i think i'm not too sure but this is a really good quality brush and it's really soft and this brush here the foundation brush i use this as a brush like the way i would use a one o nine brush because it's very good at stippling in the foundation blending it in i really like this brush and it's not round um it's like tapered there and the reason why i like that is because if you want to do um your foundation like this you can you can use it all different ways and sometimes i use it for cream blush to do it like that do um a straight line lash and contouring as well even though it's um like synthetic fibers i still use it for contouring so there are my two brushes there i have two mascaras from my favorite first one is it's probably been in my favorites for the last couple of times and the reason why i just love this one is because of the um the brush um the formulation and i use this only for my lower lash i don't use it for my top lash i love it for my lower lash and i'm wearing it today if you can see i'm using that today and i absolutely love this and mascara for that purpose and i don't use it for my top lash the only reason because it gives you length which i don't really look for in a mascara i look for volume and thickness so that's why i use this for my bottom lashes and the second mascara is the bourjois coup de theatre coup de theatre two in one um again the formulation of um this mascara is brilliant i love the brush it's the plastic combed brushes there and i just spent my because i think it's much easier to use as a um to use it makes it easier because if you can see it just gets in more better than a strip brush and the formulation is really good it makes my lashes look thicker and it gives that wee bit of volume i really find a good mascara that gives me the color but it gives me volume and thickness which is really good and another thing is the matte luster drops the reason why i love this it gives you that really nice bronzy glowy look which i love i always mix it in with my foundation haven't really used it as a highlight but for a foundation it's brilliant it gives you this really nice shiny glowy effect if you're looking for that that dewy look which is supposed to be really in for autumn as well which is really good and yeah i really love it and the one i have it in is in sunrush i wish i got more of these actually because i only got one of them now i want more of them so yeah really like that another mark daniel is my mineralized eye shadow which is from their permanent line i think it's the jewels and the one i like is play on plums which is this gorgeous plumy color at the top and this orange plumy color at the bottom because it has that plum color at the end of the bottom like all over here and i'll do you a quick swatch and there's the darker color here and the lighter color there that's what i'm using on my eyes today if you're wondering and yeah i used to put a black in the outer corners just to smoke it out a wee bit but i really love it it's great when you use it with fixed glass of water but if you use it dry you'll find a lot of fall out there's less fall out and the sha eye shadow's more intense um yeah nail polish of the month has to be my my um bright purple which i've been using a lot this month i'm not using it today but i love it it's just a gorgeous black purple color it's great for summer it was great for the summer and now it's great for um the autumn as well this purple is really in and two lip products first one is my maybelline um i don't know what type of lipstick it's a maybelline lipstick i know that and the color is and it's this gorgeous brown medium brown color there which is really lovely and for a nude color and there's this swatch it's really moisturizer and it doesn't really dry my lips or anything and the only downside is doesn't last long but most of my lipsticks don't last long but it's really moisturizing and i'd really recommend this lipstick and second lipstick is from the number seventeen range from in the uk and this is one is the lasting fix lipstick in hawaii pink this is a really nice bright bubble gum pur pink color color and that's really nice to go with nude lips does it match my nail polish it kind of matches my nail polish i'm wearing pink flamingo if you're wondering and yeah this is a really nice lipstick it's not as moisturizing as the maybelline one but it's a great color payoff there if you can see that's it there it's a gorgeous color yeah so and last but not least my favorite eye liner of the month is my gosh eyeliner in black ink it's really creamy and it's not that hard like i heard most of my gosh eyeliners have been disappointing for some people because it's been hard and everything um i have this and i have alligator which is the green one and both of them have worked perfectly fine for me and they're really nice and creamy and they haven't dried me out or anything so and they stay on my eyes for a long time because i think they're waterproof yeah they're waterproof which is really good as well so um that's my favorite guys and i hope you enjoyed if you have any um questions or queries just leave a comment down below and comment me and subscribe thanks bye,,1382

600,okay take two um did you ever have one of those days where you just felt like an alien from another planet i mean everywhere you go it's like weird like you go in the grocery store and you're like you know somebody says um did you find everything you need and i'm like well um i could use a million dollars and it's like it's just hm like they don't even respond i mean that's kinda lame but you know they could say something i mean every person i encountered today was just so not funny at all it was bizarre i was like i don't know it's the kinda day that you you walk away and like not one single person smiles at you or laughs at anything you say and they just look at you like you're crazy and you go home and you like start thinking that you're a loser because like you talk too much and you say stupid stuff and like you just open your mouth to change feet and you just feel like a total loser because you're not funny you're not funny at all and you're so not funny that you begin to really like freak out and think what's wrong with me and then like you get on your ipod and you start listening to all this depressing music and like you're so into that like depressing mood you know it's like emo and you're listening to this stuff and you're just like oh my god i'm such a loser i am such a loser i want to jump off a cliff and then like all of a sudden your ipod shuffles and it's like amazing grace or something that you put on there like ten years ago when you like never had an ipod before but i mean it's like all a sudden then you're like oh jesus i love you thank you so much for i'm so glad i'm alive and then all of a sudden like that other stuff starts splaying again and then all of a sudden you're like jamming to boston and it's like you're thinking about the old days and then you start to think oh my god i'm old i remember when boston more than a feeling came out and then like that makes you feel worse because not only now are you not funny and you talk too much now you're old too wow okay that's like so depressing,,416
601,hi everyone uh yeah i know it's been at least two and a half weeks maybe three weeks since i've made a video um i want to make this video uh for it should help out some of my um fellow feministas especially uh feminists in canada um i've noticed that um when you uh speak out very loudly against the patriarchy um whether you're talking about uh pornography or domestic violence or the men's rights movement or the tfl movement any any of that stuff when you go up against it you will sometimes encounter a massive amount of resistance and that's simple backlash misogyny that most feminists are aware of but the main reason i want to make this video is because in canada you you can do something about this if um someone is harassing you uh or posting personal information about you um threatening you intimidating you that is a violation of the criminal code of canada and i will tell you the steps of what you need to do to uh open a file and make sure that you know you have a case and you're it's open and you're protected the first thing that you need to do is wherever you live uh call the rcmp or um you know if you're in a city if you have a city police force you can call them but uh all of the uh police forces have um an internet uh crime division and um so basically what'll happen is you'll call them you'll let them know what's happening and uh the constables will come to uh where you live and they will uh look over uh the data uh they will open a file and um you will then email them uh a lot of stuff if the threat is um particularly um bad uh you know they'll they'll get to work on it right away but usually um after they come to your place they will go back to uh the office and they will um work start work on your case right away so the most important thing that you need to do is you need to document things and uh your constable will um uh give you an email address and um phone numbers and things like that so that if anything escalates uh you can just continue to send all the data now when they go back to the office um basically they find out who it is so they monitor who these people are and um so there is recourse um you know i i know what's happening to um antique lens it happened to me and so you know um i think in all the years of me being on the internet i've um opened two case files against two people and um one of them is still open uh the other one is closed for now but can be opened at any time uh so um yeah i mean you're if youtube isn't going to do anything about it they don't you don't need youtube's cooperation the rcmp will handle this and and it is a violation of the criminal code and you can look it up online it's there i can't remember what section it is but um it is there so this is just to help my um um my fellow feministos in canada um if you have any other questions that you want to ask me about the procedure or the process just drop me a private message and um i'll answer as fast as i can with what i know so that's it for now it's really good to see everybody coming on the uh on the feminist two group uh that's really really good so i'm i'm happy that it's growing um i've just been really busy um i got a promotion and i'm moving to whistler so um yeah that's and of course near the holidays i'm extremely busy with my job so anyway it's good to uh say hi to everyone out there again and uh oh maybe i'll do my my queenly wave you know she does that little that little wave ha anyway um peace out blessed be and ciao til next time,,714

604,zero rushing touch downs this entire season so far zero rushing touchdowns zero point zero pretty simple but interesting question was asked to both terrell owens and to trent edwards the question was if you were a fan today in the stands would you too have been booing the team terrell owens response yeah i'm pretty sure i would they deserve better and i agree with him there um i wasn't in the stands yesterday but i was a fan booing when asked the same question in the post game press conference to trent edwards here's his answer i'm not a bills fan i'm a football player here so i can't really answer that question well well fans out there i think we just found part of the problem our quarterback's not a fan of the team apparently not on any level because if he was on any level he would have answered like terrell owens who said you know what yeah i would have booed because that was just a total disgrace the sloppiest crappiest football i've ever seen but no his answer i'm i'm not a fan i'm a player here maybe that's why you know there's a little bit of lack of passion you know um let's talk about the penalties thirteen accepted penalties there was actually much more called i'm pretty sure they got to like sixteen maybe seventeen penalties called thirteen penalties accepted and of those thirteen nine of them were false starts what nine false starts roscoe parrish's fumble sort of remind you of anything maybe uh game one of the season monday night against the patriots don't touch it don't touch it don't tou what he touched it oh my god the browns got the ball lee evans in a post game interview said to a reporter in the locker room quote i can't stand it i can't stand to see it get much worse well uh nice statement lee cause neither can any of us fans would i can't possibly think that this could get much worse but guess what we have to go to the meadowlands next week and play the jets okay dick jauron has lost every single divisional game for the bills since december ninth of two thousand and seven and the bills are zero and eight since then losing every single afc east game they've played last year and two of them this year since dick jauron signed his contract extension dick jauron with the bills is three in twelve since that contract extension and one in seven at home i have a hard time believing that anyone on this team is still fully behind dick jauron and you know if the players aren't behind the coach you end up with a game like this past sunday,,469

606,okay so sunday i took the kids the kids to the mall because it was raining we couldn't skate just just don't ask questions okay that's what we did we went to the mall bad idea it's way too close to christmas very packed not fun don't do it anyways um so we went into the skate shop surf shop we sell girls underwear kind of place um i live four hours away from the ocean so for anybody to actually surf around here is kind of uncommon i don't know why there is a surf shop here i mean i assume they have them at the beach as well so why not just wait till you got the beach to buy your but anyways anyways surf shop in the mall oh that makes a whole lot of sense um shit that pisses me off so anyways what we do is we always go in there and we we raise a little alley you know we try on the wet suits which by the way smell like frog i don't know if you guys knew that wet suits smell like frog but that might just be because i've been in every single uh wet suit in there and uh sweat in them which makes them sweat suits just kidding um they smell like frogs though seriously um and like stick up little little local skate shop stickers and it it it's good times okay we we best thing to do okay when we go in there ask them questions about their skateboards it's hilarious okay so i go back there and i i've been doing a little bit of research on these new gimmick skateboard skateboards like like the almost impact and the and the pearlite and obviously the p two um so i see the pearlite on the wall and i'm like okay this is gonna be fun i walked into the guy i'm like hey what can you tell me about that uh that plan b pearlite over there he gets it out and he's like um reads the packaging it's its lighter thinner stronger yeah that's what the packaging says that's exactly what it is i hear great things about these all the time they're just they're awesome you should probably buy one like right now and i'm like good god dude and i'm freaking i went into this whole spiel i'm pretty sure i quoted the entire website on his ass awesome awesome and then this kid walks up i wish he had done that when i was owning the dude and he's like hey i want that baker board over there and i want it gripped with jessup jessup makes you mess up okay dawn that's for you that was a little weird i'm not gonna laugh anyways so the guy the guy's trying to grip this board right and and he's trying to train this other dude too because well i don't really know it was kind a like the blind leading the blind but anyways he just kind a throws the grip tape at it and it sticks and it's its like i don't know how it stuck and had that many bubbles in it it was absolutely insane i don't understand how that even happened it looked like a hot dog with with you know the baker logo on the bottom down here and the grip tape on the top it was ridiculous i don't know how he got that many air bubbles in it he didn't sand down the edges he just sat there and he poked out all the air bubbles with pins and then flattened out the grip tape i was like you idiot i wanna slap you on the freaking mouth right now i have literally not wanted to grip a board so bad in my entire life like i just wanted to push him out of the way like flip him over the glass counter and do it myself pisses me off it was so bad and then he doesn't he doesn't file down the edges or anything like that that you would normally do when you're gripping a skateboard no no he just throws the grip tape on there and starts trying to cut it out and can't figure out why it's all freaking wavy and crap and it doesn't look anything like it should look it was awful it looked disgusting i wanted to punch him in the mouth anyways that's one story another story shit i forgot which one i was gonna tell you guys ah what did we do oh yeah um so local skate shop again was having this this contest for t shirt designs and skateboard designs and deshawn had drawn up a bunch of designs and uh he didn't realize that because he wasn't eighteen yet he couldn't enter the contest without his parent's signature and i wasn't about to drive a half hour to go home to get his mom to sign a sheet of paper and then drive back so the guys at the skate shop were like hey if you just go out to the car and sign this yourself we'll never know and i'm like well that's a lot less fun so what we're gonna do is we're going to the mall and we'll talk to you guys in a little bit so we were walking in the mall and we were looking for a girl any girl would've done really but we got all the way to this malinick's place before we found anybody and we got in there and there's these two cute little blond girls sitting at the counter not doing anything because that place doesn't sell shit because they fucking bick but anyways so we get up there and deshawn is like hey i need you guys to sign this so that i could get in this contest right and they were like oh cool we could do that yeah we could pretend to be your mom what's your name he tells her his name and shit like that and they're they're taking turns writing on this sheet of paper not the actual form but just random pieces of paper to see who has the better signature and they finally decided who has the better signature and they sign it and they're like oh cool i hope you win that contest don't break your arm or anything i'm like you fucking idiots it says right on it that it's an art competition he's drawing something is he really gonna break his arm drawing something they thought this was a legitimate skate contest and that pound deshawn was gonna be in it

607,hey guys so like ten in the morning and i've been up like all night i woke up yesterday at like oh about two thirty in the afternoon yesterday then i went back to sleep because i was really tired then i slept til like six so i've been up since then it's like yeah i'm getting pretty tired i really want to go to sleep but you know i'll just end up sleeping all day and then i'll be up all night again starts that cycle you know this is what happens when you go out drinking and then you have a really bad hangover the next day which makes you sleep all day so i think the lesson here is don't go out and drink and get a hangover the next day you know avoid the hangover maybe drink some v eight i don't know i mean i usually don't get really get bad hangovers but for some reason anyways not much is new here still unemployed you know living the good life of being a bum and partying non stop while being a broke ass then sleeping all day yep so um i did have a job interview on saturday it went really well until they gave me a drug test yeah never had to do a drug test for a job before it was just like that swab test where you keep that thing in your mouth for like a minute or so so everything went great on the interview and then it was like okay we'll just give you a drug test and i was like okay you know i can all like everything's cool i'm not a druggie which i'm not i don't really do drugs anymore and i don't even smoke weed anymore i quit up until like last week like i was totally clean right i haven't done anything in so long and i didn't even smoke i don't smoke anymore i smoke on or i smoked on new year's eve like a little bit and i didn't even like it really you know i don't like that feeling so um yeah then last week i uh was just at this party and my friend was like oh i'll buy you some pills and i was like well i haven't done it in so long like a year and a half probably or more so i was like why not if you're gonna buy it for me why not so yeah and that was like a week ago or last friday so like more than a week ago and apparently like i looked up those those drug tests online the saliva ones they can only tell the drugs that have been in your system for like three days or something three or four days so it was a good like seven to eight days so maybe it will come out good i mean i really hope so because i'm getting really sick of this whole being a bum thing i mean my car insurance expires today so no more driving for me unless i want to risk getting pulled over and getting a ticket for no car insurance and then i have to pay like so much money if i got a ticket which is totally not even worth it so this just sucks you know but i should be finding out about that job like what's to day tuesday tomorrow or thursday so i'm really hoping for that you know it was kind of a lame job i would be a bagger at safeway which is a grocery store i'd be one of those baggers bag your food for you asking old ladies if they need help out to their car i'd be that sad miserable person pushing the carts around in the snow out of the parking lot but hey it's a job oh right um so this morning i was sleeping right and don't ya freaking hate it when people call you when you're sleeping yeah i do so my friend calls me and i'm all sleeping you know i was so tired so i grab my phone to hit ignore and i don't know if you can see over there there's like a coffee cup right over there on my nightstand there's my bed i'm sleeping there you know yeah and uh i hit ignore and then put it on my nightstand goes right into the coffee cup yeah i hear this like dunk and splash or whatever so i'm like oh crap so i reach in the coffee cup and i pull it out and i just like shook it off and then threw it on the floor i didn't wake up to see like if it was all right if it was broken you know i didn't give a shit i just wanted to sleep but it's all good see it's a little sticky i didn't wash it off yet but it's good no damage done score shit i just called someone sorry anyways i think that does it for my video once i find something interesting to talk about maybe i'll make another one all right,,871
608,so even though my dear friend could not be here with us right now i will show you a photo of the stocking that she she did make that should be going up some where in front of my face now yeah soak it in that's right boom not just any stalking a uh a uh tube sock stocking go and of course you know i had to make something bizarre and seemingly clever in my own opinion and so i made oh goodness i made a um stocking for an octopus there you go it is an eight legged stocking for an octopus because i think you know they want to celebrate under the sea right but don't fret kiddies it does have an actual like stocking hole so it's a fully functional uh stocking for octopi i think that's yes that's plural for octopus right i'm going to talk a little bit quieter now as far as what i want for christmas honestly it sounds so sappy and it sounds so like rehearsed but i don't know there is nothing that i really want i mean you can ask my parents i haven't asked for anything for christmas because aw it sounds lame but the things i want for christmas you can't like put a price on like i just want to be in good health i want my friends to be happy all of my family to be safe i want to be successful at what i do i want to come up with cool ideas and i don't know those are what i want right now as far as material go i i don't know i'm pretty blessed and i have like i have what i want i can't really think of anything else like a possession or something that i need i just i mean of course i would love more books i would love more movies and music and things like that but nothing that i want badly enough to just like put on list and ask somebody to buy it for me so i don't know i don't really have a a christmas list i literally have not made one and i haven't asked for anything because uh anyways at random and like don't let me guilt you into thinking that you're you're not supposed to want a christmas list it's totally cool if you want stuff for christmas if you want all of that cool stuff by all means write your little heart out to santa until you your little heart can't write no more i don't know if you can tell but i'm tired so i am going to end this video it is well apple says it is one ten in the morning so i am going to edit this and get some sleep by sleep i mean watch some more supernatural on dvd until it is a stupid hour in the morning and then wish that i didn't stay up that long happy holidays so first and foremost couldn't be part of the vlog portion this time around because my camera actually died while we were at her house she did however give me a list of things she wanted for christmas but i suck and i don't think i took the list with me so i'm gonna try to remember what was on it she wanted rocket powered something yeah some kind of appliance that's like powered by rockets confusingly enough i also think she wanted the first season of rocket power on dvd she could have put boy meets world on dvd maybe sere i am such a bad friend me and are just artistic masochists who decided to keep drawing even though it's not part of the challenge bottom line is after we were done with our stockings we continued drawing and we both did uh santa claus now the first santa claus i'm gonna show you is the one made whoa bang so this is s sexy santa he's got liver spots a not so happy trail fishnets a cookie hand cool nips stretch marks a cookie gut oh and a happy in cookie hand i took a different route and i am not a lover like sexy santa i am a fighter so i made brutal santa,,723

612,hello so guys this is my hundred fifty first ever blog the reason i'm telling you about my hundred fifty first blog is because i forgot that my last one was my hundred fiftieth somehow a hundred fifty seems like a more rounded suitable number for a milestone than a hundred fifty one but you're just going to have to deal with it cause i forgot so yeah hundred fifty first video wanted to do something cool to celebrate couldn't think of anything cool to do to celebrate so what i'm going to do i know a lot of people make awesome cakes and stuff i'm just going to tell you a joke it's my favorite joke in the whole world okay here's my joke i've actually said this joke in a blog before but i'm hoping that none of you remember because if you do remember i'm gonna feel kind of stupid for recycling my joke anyway this is my absolute specialty of a joke it is my uber cool amazing awesome perfect joke that i'm building up really badly and you're probably gonna be really disappointed two muffins are in an oven one muffin says cor it's a bit hot in here and the other muffin says aah a talking muffin isn't that joke just amazing though because i think i first heard that joke when i was like ten and i remember thinking when i was ten that is you know that is one hell of a joke but in the last two days i have come across three people who don't understand that joke now it's all fine when someone doesn't understand a joke but when they analyze the joke and pick apart the joke and are like this joke doesn't make sense because this is this that really bugs me it's like you don't get it just shut up about it not that i'm pointing fingers at anyone tom seeing as you wanted a shout out here's your shout out you ruined my joke why'd you ruin my joke i'm only joking it was fine that you ruined my joke i won't hold it against you can everyone please leave their favorite jokes in the comments cause it will just be fun for me to read and if there's any really good ones i'll read them out in my next video anyway what have i been doing lately i've been watching x factor lately which i don't even want to talk about because i'm just still too angry about it and on saturday i went on a school trip to see plays about sex trafficking which was very very depressing because you kinda think that that sort of thing only happens in third world countries and really like undeveloped places but there's fifty illegal sex trade places in croydon alone which in context is like a small part of london that was really really really hard hitting and it made me think that we suck as a country i'm gonna just say one more thing because this is like really important so i i'm sure most of you know what chartjackers is by now but if you don't basically four uk bloggers alex charlie jimmy and johnny were picked by the bbc and asked if they would write and produce and perform using the youtube community i'm just using my head instead of my hands cause i'm holding my laptop on my knees um the song that they were gonna release in the charts for children in need which was done and now all that needs to happen is that everyone needs to buy the song so that we can raise loads and loads and loads and loads of money for children in need so i'm going to put a link in the sidebar to the song which you can buy from itunes and children in need own the song now so every single penny goes to them so it will be so good if you could buy the song even if you hate the song but you won't hate the song cause it's an amazing song so yeah i'm going to go now and i'm going to leave you with this thought it's my eighteenth birthday on thursday the nineteenth november goodbye,,718
613,hey everyone it's and it's been a while since i've put anything on my personal channel but i thought this would be a good mix with the type of video the caliber if you will of videos that i posted on my personal channel um whether i'm stuck in a box or uh you know a spider down below uh i think that this might might fit well uh i had mentioned that i learned via darrings dance grooves i don't know if any of you used it back in like eighth grade or something or maybe you young's are too young for it but um darrings dance grooves helped me learn a chorus of britney spears you drive me crazy so i danced it up for you guys i just did it so it's a little bit backwards but um i learned it and i did it and it's there so uh don't judge me too harshly i have no dance background i just i just like to dance just got to dance screw girls tonight i just want to dance you can not do you drive me crazy i just can't sleep i'm so excited i'm in too deep ohh crazy but it feels all right baby thinking of you keeps me up all night i just wanted to say hey and um i know that i've had a bunch more new new viewers so thank you so much i'm glad that you think i'm interesting i guess that is kind of validating for the for the things that i do in my life so i hope that you stick around that you comment and send video responses if you have learned anything on darrings dance grooves fess up whether it's via video or comments i want to hear about it um i am like always on here doing the weirdest things i'm so sorry i feel like i huh it's it's three in the morning you guys this is like the afternoon for me i i all my friends get tired and then i am still up so i do this this is my life i am a vampire i know that you lesbians are really into vampires i don't know why well actually i do because i think it's pretty hot too but um but i am a vampire i stay up late at night i rarely see the sun as you can tell by my pale complexion i just i just want to talk to someone i wish that other people were awake at am and would like do this stupid shit with me cause it's not really fun when i'm doing it alone and talking to my computer you know when when you watch it it doesn't seem so weird because you're like watching it but when i'm doing it alone in my house at three a m little creepy so this is my life i'm living it okay byyyyyyyyyye,,496
614,and don't you think it's really annoying when people apologize like over apologize about not making a video i'm really the victim like the viewers but i i i always feel like i want to apologize when i don't make a video for a very long time it's like i did vanish but not really so i've been doing nothing in a really good way i guess yeah in a in a really good way do nothing in a really good fun just making making a video too bet you want to see my face even though my hair covers it anyway um but i've also been wondering what makes somebody shallow like not limited to like physical parents but when you find out someone you're interested in and like really into music that you don't like or an artist you absolutely hate and that's such a turn off that you're not attracted to that person any more is that is that considered shallow or something something like that if if you like uh very um deep things so i guess it is but i don't know what are your thoughts please tell me i can't trick my own thoughts oh i got a little bit tanner not too much tanner but a little little bit tanner so it doesn't look like i'm boo radley uh to kill a mockingbird sometimes i just like making faces like now hi i'm just waiting for my camera to change colors okay i think that's it so it's been a really long time um i don't really have an excuse but i'm just in a frump really you can understand that,,278
615,today is going to be a very different video than any video that i've done before it's because today i'm going to be asking you for help now during the summer of the group got together and we decided that it would be really really good for us and good for the community if we got together and did a charity event now we went through a lot of charity ideas lot of different organizations great organizations but the one that we actually came up with in the end to raise funds for was the st jude children's research hospital we came up with that one specifically for two reasons number one they are at the forefront of science research to eliminate cancer from our society the second reason was their direct involvement with children st jude children's research hospital works directly with children and never turns a child away because of their inability to pay the bill so many cases all over the united states children who are sick and stricken down with cancer and really need some serious help but they don't have the ability to pay can go there and get world class treatment without the worrying of being able to pay for some of the experimental treatments or some of the great care that they get at st jude children's research hospital now we batted around a lot of ideas also as far as what to actually do what kind of charity to do now a few months ago a lot of you remember that dpr did a great charity event a twenty four hour marathon to raise money for doctors without borders now we had thought about that honestly um as a way to raise money but that was kind of the idea that cemented it so what we're going to do is this we're going to take the basic premise of a charity marathon on blog tv and we're going to up the ante a little bit we are going to up the ante in several ways first off we are going to be asking for donations we have a page set up and a link to that page will be in the side bar this is a page set up directly through st jude children's research hospital so as soon as you make a contribution one hundred percent of that money will go directly to them and go right to work helping cancer research and helping children who need it the second thing that we're going to be doing is the ebay channel now that is an idea that we did directly steal from dpr and sorry for that um i spoke with him and he said it's for a great charity then go for it we're going to be donating items directly for that and we're also going to be asking for items that you would like to donate to go on to the ebay channel and one hundred percent of the money that we get from that will go directly also to st jude children's research hospital now the final way that we're going to collect money is this when you were in school a lot of you remember doing rockathons or walkathons or mathathons that's similar to what we're going to do for our final stage what it comes down to is this on the eighteenth of december that's a friday morning i'm gonna to wake up and i'm gonna to sit down in front of the camera the charity event itself has no time limit whatsoever i will continue to talk i will continue to bring on co hosts i will read papers i will read articles i'll discuss issues anything that i can do to stay awake and to keep going we're asking people to pledge money x amount of dollars or x amount of cents for every hour that i stay on and then at the end when i actually finish when my head literally hits the keyboard that's going to be the stop time then we'll multiply however much you pledged times how many hours we lasted and that will be your donation amount um i understand that this is going to happen on december eighteenth that's another hiccup that we've come up with um throughout many hiccups actually so i understand the time frame of christmas being right there that's why we're not going to ask for the donations until the thirtieth of january at the on the thirtieth of january that's when we will ask for all the donations to be in so we'll do a final check cut and send that directly to st jude children's research hospital and we'll also be clearing out the bank account showing that on camera also as a little field trip exercise to actually head to memphis and to uh give it to them personally to make sure that they get every penny that you donate now what we're doing now is uh we've reserved a hotel room to start us off in so we're going to be broadcasting this from somewhere not here where we can actually have people we're going to be doing a cooking show we've got a bunch of things planned that go beyond just me sitting in front of a camera uh so i'll be showing you my famous spinach lasagna um we'll be cooking that we'll also have a grab bag but more details about all of that stuff will come in the following weeks i'm going to try to plan to do one video every week showing you the progress and whose uh whose in for co hosting and little things that we have planned so for now what i wanted to leave you with is the general idea of what we're planning to do we're also going to be asking for co hosts anybody who wants to come on if you find a great news article if you have something that you just really want to discuss and get opinions on feel free to send us a pm or send an email i'm going to put the email right here right about now so that you can see it so it will be occamsrazorsua at yahoo dot com we're looking forward to getting your ideas we want to know what you think about it we would love to have um as many articles as many things as many topics as many issues as we can raise in this time frame now i'm going to say again this has no time limit whatsoever we start on friday morning when we end simply depends on when i can't talk anymore or when i can't blog anymore or when i can't continue so like i said before we'll be doing more videos to update you as we get more information and thank you for watching this and stay tuned for this little quick snippet oh i won't back down no i won't back down you can stand me up at the gates of hell but i won't back down no i won't back down my feet turned around in a world that keeps on pushing me around i'm gonna stand my ground and i won't back down i won't back down baby there ain't no easy way out but i i will stand my ground and i won't back down cause i know so what we're asking for now is for people to give us a hand to volunteer to co host to moderate the chat to donate money to donate items to pledge money to mirror this video basically we're asking for anyone who can give us a hand with making this a really good charity to please do so so my only question to you is who's in oh baby there ain't no easy way out,,1316
616,alright today we've come together on a very rainy day it's not just a rainy day it's raining carrots today on this very rainy day it's raining carrots everywhere in the entire world people come together and celebrate the rainy day or carrots and not only are they happy they also are a little bit sad because some people don't like carrots and when it rains carrots people who don't like carrots are not very happy with it so most of the people like this day but a lot of you don't and i know it's sad but you have to make the best out of it i mean it's raining carrots and you can't help it so you should just adjust yourself and start liking carrots because it will be rainy day carrots for a long time with that i mean it will be raining carrots for a lot of time and i have some tips for you if you don't like carrots because if you don't like them you are not happy as i've said before which is kind of illogical but hey some people don't know it so my first step is just stand on a bridge where it does not rain carrots you should kneel down and say i like to eat sandwiches with toothpaste on it from that very moment from when you said that word that sentence you will not like carrots because it makes no sense however if just start eating carrots against your own will you might find yourself happy one day and you look back and you say hmm that time when it rained carrots oh that was a good time you know why it's raining carrots right you don't all right i was trying to briefly explain why it's raining carrots but if you don't understand it then it's not my fault i mean i'm not the one who made it up right right right anyways let's continue it's raining carrots for just one obvious reason that obvious reason is because it's hot in australia in australia the kangaroos hop around with high tech micro sound wave whatever the hell that may be the high tech micro sound wave is another word for an mp three three player it plays music and therefore it started raining carrots in the entire world so we have to blame the kangaroos in australia because it's very hot in there seriously we have to,,410

621,i've been on youtube for two years that's what it tells me at least and i realized that two years is a long time of just watching videos just watching i've kept a live journal for like forever since i was in middle school and it was good it was one step closer to discovering who i was cause i'm a creative writer it's it's what i do but i realized that text was a mask the pretty words and the pretty metaphors were just a mask i was putting up for myself and i realized that the only way i could really truly know myself is by looking at myself watching myself talk and a lot of your own videos inspired me to do that it was you that got me into vlogging i've always kinda wanted to but you convinced me that that words only got me so far text was hiding behind the screen of my monitor i think it was that vlog you did dealing with depression i loved that one that one really spoke to me and you're right you know and i don't always understand your videos sometimes they could just fly over my head but i've never bitched about it you know the reason why i'm subscribed to you is like it's because every time you post a video i feel i wonder if i'll understand you this time you know with every video you post i hope that i'll understand this one maybe this one will get me closer to understanding you so thank you thanks,,264

623,this weekend i'm going to the new york city anime festival what is that it's basically an anime convention and i've been to a few of these so i've decided to file this video for tips and tricks to have a wonderful kind of experience first off is money it's going to cost money for the tickets i personally get a weekend pass so you can go the whole weekend for manga day you're going to need probably more money or less money depending on the convention prices and the city i usually set aside an extra twenty bucks so i can get a t shirt transportation is also going to run you some money since we're in manhattan i can take the subway out there and then hop on a bus and be there in no time i go there twice a day that's two twenty five with a transfer so that's only four fifty a day i got to put about between something about a fifteen dollar metro card a lot of free stuff so bring a bag i have a bag that i use just for this kind of thing i have a small tin in it which i use cause i have a lot of business cards a lot of small stickers bookmarks stuff like that cause this they will give usually have bags you can get for free but i prefer cause a lot of this stuff cause this is going to be pretty cool so i recommend bringing a camera i'm bringing a camera i'm gonna carry i'm gonna carry my camera in this bag hold it around my neck so with your camera in mind you're gonna need batteries because the batteries might die or you might friend of your's he might need them so i i try to purchase a twelve pack for the con also a memory card wouldn't hurt i plan to bring my spare memory card in case this one gets full up cause you will be doing a lot of pictures and i plan on doing some filming this weekend now you're going to get hungry you're walking around all day you're gonna get hungry now there's food there usually it's pretty fucking expensive there so i'm gonna make so i would recommend making sandwiches or filling up a glad bag chips trail mix power bars granola bars pretzels maybe stuff like that or for me now where i'm going there's a mcdonalds two blocks away i go there you'll find people from the con there trust me you can get a quick quick lunch head back to the convention that's of course if you are willing to leave the convention center for it also bring a bottle a water it's going to be hot in there there's a lot of people well i guess that's about it um if you have any more tips or tricks leave a comment or a video response telling me and everyone else who watches this,,504
624,hey everybody op let me ah hey everybody its grab yourself a piping hot ice cold glass of coca cola for this fireside chat oh my gosh that's so good hah man that's good ice cold coke in our house is the best um we think so although we've been off coke for we were off coke in the house for months months months months we were only having like kool aid and water and stuff like that but it's a now the cake's done okay the timer stopped i all ready took it out i made a cake actually i didn't make a cake i poured it out of the box and mixed it up and put it into a pan let's go get it let me go get it for you this chair is so rolly look at that it's covered in cinnamon and um it's a cinnamon swirl quick bread it's got layers of cinnamon in the middle i think it's going to be good it's really hot right now okay sorry for that interruption um a couple things going on today we went to the grocery store so we go to different grocery stores depending what's on sale and what we need and so forth the dog is over in the living room she takes her toys and then she throws them in the air and chases after them like she plays catch with herself which is good it entertains herself but um i think she thinks someone else is throwing it and it's her doing it she's like oh they threw it this way this time i'll go get it it's funny she knows i'm talking about too i can tell um anyway a couple things ah i probably all ready started to talk about here comes darla here she goes right through the video good job good job she's got one of those hawaiian bread rolls hawaiian sweet bread yeah do they even have hawaiian sweet bread in hawaii or is that just something that's got us mainlanders hooked on thinking it's like some special treat from hawaii when really it's made in slabtown north carolina anyway let me tell i know what i was telling you we went to the grocery store today we go to different grocery stores based on what we need what the sales are and so forth well tonight um we went to aldi i don't know if probably not all of you have aldi i'm not sure aldi is like a german or belgian company i'm not i think it's german um and they like open up these grocery stores here and they're like non frills no frills at all um they've got their system they are not going to waver from it ah they don't provide bags free of charge they don't um you have to put a quarter in the shopping cart or as they call them here in the south put a quarter in the buggy you have to put a quarter in the buggy to ah release it ah and the reason they do that is so that you will return that cart to the corral to get your quarter back it has like this mechanism to get your quarter back out um they don't have a lot of people working there when they scan your groceries they just scan them and throw them into the cart and then you bag them yourself it's this whole but they have got the whole system it's good for certain things some things we don't like but as it turns out our next door neighbor is the store manager for our the aldi that's close to us um which is funny because he always comes over and we joke with him about this he will come over like ten o'clock at night and be like do you guys have an egg or do you have a cup of milk what was he here for the other night do you have any cooking spray don't they have that at the grocery store were you just spent sixteen straight hours it just always cracks us up because you know that's like me coming home from work and calling my neighbor and saying do you have a piece of copy paper so anyway today i thought it was funny one of the things that caught my eye in the grocery store was bacon we don't buy bacon all the time but it is one of my favorite things so today um i was comparing the prices looking at the weight you know i compare how much is it per ah per ounce and i do all of that when i grocery shop just because you know sometimes it's deceiving if you've got bacon is pretty much all the same i thought until today now i know better um but you know you've got your hickory smoked you've got your thick sliced you've got your uh maple cured huh brown maple cured yeah cured all these different kinds well i found a new kind today yep the economy has finally taken a toll on the bacon industry this is the bacon i ended up with see if you can see this it's economy sliced it's economy sliced bacon which from what i can tell i haven't opened it yet but what i can tell is that it's sliced super duper thin it's economy sliced well i didn't even see the economy sliced thing until i got home um but it's a pound uh which is interesting because bacon lately has been twelve ounces it seems like and this is a whole pound of bacon and it was under two dollars i'm pretty sure like maybe it was two point two four i don't know pretty good price when we get it on sale you can get it for like two for four dollars but then it's like twelve ounces but this is a whole pound um but it's economy sliced it's economy sliced never never heard of that um i guess they're just using any old any old economy related word they can to hock their product it's economy sliced oh something else new about me i like jazz music now i'm a jazz connoisseur well not exactly but i have one cd we were in barnes and noble yesterday yesterday yeah yesterday and um i said i like jazz now i want to buy a jazz cd the very first one in my life and i owned hundreds of cds so i got this paul hardcastle the collection and i got it because it was the first one that i put in and listen to on the ah barnes and noble you know you can scan any cd in the music section and hear what's on it well it was the first one that i scanned and i thought that sounds like jazz i like it i bought it um so that's what plays in my car now um until i get tired of that um what else and um maybe that's it i'm uh i'm trying to blog more can you tell ah the cake the bacon the jazz i worked today a little bit that was all okay i'm going to let you go keep this shorter than it was and i'll to try to edit some stuff out to make it even shorter um just to let you know its seven minutes and forty three seconds so when you watch this edited video you see how much i cut out i don't know yet okay peace out westside and vogue um you know madonna um started the whole vogue thing how it made its way into my videos i don't know um i don't particularly like that song um i i don't know how that vogue thing started um but now i'm thinking um i'm going to pick up something new like that peace out westside and i don't know i'm gonna give me a suggestion okay lady ga ga lady ga ga okay cause i'll need about you know a spackle and a gallon of makeup all right bye it's economy sliced it's economy sliced and it was on the left and i just reached over and grabbed it and then i just remember yup it was a dollar eighty nine,,1405

628,hey guys you knew this rant was coming my rant about women women in general now let me start off with women are very judgmental oh no no i'm not no i always care about the person's personality to and extent you guys don't give a fuck about the personality of a man okay you can walk into a room three guys sitting there and you know all of them first one kind of looks like robert pattinson a little bit and he's kind of a jerk middle one kind of and average joe not the best looking but he's there but he doesn't have the personality of being your boyfriend third one kind like a little bit over weight ugly but really funny really nice personality and cares about people who are you going to go for you're going to go for the robert pattinson guy because he's the guy that you can take back to your friends and gloat look at my hot ass boyfriend yet he's probably going to cheat on you because that's what hot jerk assholes do they are like i have one girl let's see if i can get two even four who the fuck knows so then you're left traumatized for having your heart broken by this guy to not wanting to date any other guy for the rest of your life now guys like me we know that we are not going to be the first choice first pick of any girl but we know that later in life that the stupid girls from high school are going to come flying back to us because girls are really fucking stupid in high school when it comes to guys anyway they go for the hot guy the guy that will cheat on her the guy that will break her heart later in life she'll realize oh we wanted one of the average joe or the not so good looking guy because they're the people that are going to care those're the people who're going to care for your family they're the ones that you want to live with they're the ones that you actually want to have a life with but you're not going to realize this til your about in your thirties so ladies i'd give you advice now uh don't always go for the hottest piece of ass guy that you can that you can find because most likely they won't treat you as most other ones will okay girls are always like i want to go for the football player i want to go for the basketball player i want to go for somebody who has a good job because you're always money hungry and you're always power hungry if you can get yourself famous or something he'll go for it but there are some girls out there who think hey i care about the personality i don't care about looks well you do yeah you go to the mall and your always going to be like look at that cute guy over there you may not fall in love with him but if he greets you in a nice manner and he seams like a nice guy your head over heals in love with him already that's how guys have the greatest power over women they use their looks and their quick charm to try to take over a girl's life well her heart not necessarily her life it's to their advantage and keep them on a leash for a long time and it's not a good sign and it makes the rest of us look really bad it makes all of us look like we're a bunch of jerks like girls have always said i hate all men all men are assholes all men will cheat on you well no they won't a good a good amount probably will a large amount of men will think with their dick head and not their really head first which is not all of us you have to remember that that not all guy are bad guys just those ones that use their power and their looks to their advantage i know some guys who found out hey i'm good looking and they use it to their advantage in the wrong ways they break girls hearts left and right cheat on them and then convince them to come back with them which is not cool one bit if you want to you don't deserve the one your given that one should stay in your heart alone now i may come out as kind of a douche bag or something in this video but i'm not trying to i'm trying to convince somewhat of high school type women to realize that hey it's not always the smartest to go after the hottest guy or the guy who will give you popularity go for the ones that you truly feel in your heart are the better people not always go for the best ones and also stop leading the other ones on while you're waiting for you sweat heart to fall to his knees you have to find a friend too you find that you take that ugly guy you take the one who has a good personality who will help you move up the ladder the one who will make you feel good about yourself so much to the point that you will have enough confidence to go for that top guy but it will make the guy on the bottom feel like you care about him feel that he has a chance when really he doesn't have a chance in the world you're just using him which is not cool i know not all ladies do this but i know quite the few that have now i'm not trying to say that all girls are bitches i'm not trying to say i'm not trying to blame it on anything a lot of guys use their looks to their advantage a lot of girls play with their looks and their charm on guys who move up levels and that's not right and i hope some day you can realize that and maybe even notice some of these people around your school people who have used this against their advantage and try to help other friends stay away from these problems if you see a friend going for some guy who is known for cheating keep the girl away from him and girls just leading guys on it's not fun and of course you crush your guys heart into a powdery substance shit now this was more of a serious rant than a comedic rant sorry i really need to get some of this shit out i hope you still comment rate subscribe um make a response i would love a response it would be sweet if you could make a video response to this and uh this is this is and hopefully i don't have to make another serious pissed off rant again,,1181

632,oh hi there internet aha how are you doing i am fine yeah i just want to tell you a little story about something that happened to me this afternoon that i found quite weird and strange and very much shareable if that's a word or it's just something i'd like to share with you let's put it that way because i'm a sharer if that's even a word but if there was such a word as sharer i am one because i like to share crap that happens to me moving on see i have this book but it's not my book i'm sure it's a fantastic book um but it's not mine and the owner left it at our place and i wanted to send it back to the owner today because i'm a nice person and that's what nice people do they send books back to the people that own them right yeah so i went to the post office because this is a nice book i mean i'm i can show it back to you again it's a nice book it's a hardcover book and um i don't have like a ton of boxes that i could just use or i didn't want to wrap it up in some stuff and just you know send it and wish myself good luck that it gets there in one piece and then you know leave it at that no no no i thought hey go to the post office get a nice little package thing for the book and you know write a few words then send it back to the person that uh the book belongs to now i don't know what kind of experiences you guys have had but post offices so far like mine all have been rather negative but today topped everything i've ever seen happening in a post office so i took that book and went to the next post office i entered and it was amazing i've never seen so many people waiting in line to send their crap to other people i've never never seen anything like it seriously and there are only three people working so it was really really it was really slow process going on really slow process but i thought okay you know i have my iphone i can listen to music and i can check my emails and i can read things on twitter i'm good i'm good only problem is when there are so many people in one tiny room and they're all wrapped up in their winter clothing they tend to sweat and unfortunately stink so it was just arrgh the air in there was just disgusting the air was smelling like sweat and warm clothing you know like the wool thing tends to smell sometimes and um breath not only just breath you know like a room filled with people that were wearing clothes and they're sweating and talking to each other or breathing in general and to me i don't i'm not so good with a lot of people in a tiny space i tend to get nauseous and that was just you know the whole temperature thing it it was not a really good combination and to top that off i'm standing there in line waiting for about minutes and i didn't even get half way through the entire line but i was thinking you know what calm down you've got time you don't need to hurry up it's gonna be your turn eventually so after sixty minutes a boy at the age of i'd say four or maybe five that was also waiting in line with his mother i guess um he was standing like two meters next to me and all the sudden he threw up on the floor out of nowhere it was probably not out of blue for him but for me it was it was like this explosion of thrown up things on the floor and then there were people and more people and the mother and she was all like oh no and the boy was like crying and it was horrible and the smell oh god the smell and it was disgusting now i don't know about you but i'm one of those people that's not just like oh well there is someone who is throwing up doesn't concern me no if i see hear and smell someone throwing up right next to me it does concern me because it's kinda sickening and i'm like no i don't want to be here can you please stop throwing up i don't wanna look but i have to i don't wanna look i have to oh god i can smell him it doesn't matter if i look or not you know right after that happens my mood kinda went like this it was just bleah it was nasty and i just wanted to go home and i was so annoyed so you know i thought oh i'm gonna have to stand here for another hour really just because of a freakin book no so i was frustrated and mad and annoyed and i just went home and took a shower because i felt really gross that was just a really nasty afternoon and i just wanted to get that off i just really wanted to get that off me uch it was ooh fuck because i could've waited longer and just sent the damn book back but at that moment at that very moment i did not think that far and i'm sitting here thinking do post offices even open saturdays,,945
633,hi youtube so first off it's been a while and i apologize for that and i didn't intend for it to happen but alas it did after i made my first video i didn't really know what to put up next cause i had nothing to talk about and i'd rather put out quality videos that i think people will enjoy rather than just turning out crap every week so there is something out there so i didn't make one for about three weeks or so then i had some friends who asked me if they could borrow my camera to film something for a scholarship and of course i was like oh yeah higher education of course it's a worthy cause so i gave them my camera and then marvin was gone for three weeks so i just got him back the other day and i'm so happy that he's here and everything just great moral of the story is never let your friends borrow your camera probably the biggest news i have for you is that on this past sunday ah i went and saw demitri martin in portland and and were there too and that was great and he was as i expected a very very funny man and if you ever get the chance to go see him i would recommend doing so but the best part of it was after we left the show my friend harry and i that's who i went with my buddy harry ah we were walking by the theater and noticed there were like twenty people outside these shifty looking doors and we wanted to know what was going on so we stood there and it was just this guy who was noticeably not demitri martin loading things from the store into this car with a driver from the door to the car it's a dance we started looking at the stuff that he was loading in there and it was stuff like demitri's keyboard demitri's guitar so i looked at harry and we both got really excited and then the guy came out and whispered something to the driver who drove around the block really fast so we followed the driver to the other side of the theater and then out comes demitri martin in all his shining glory and he's just like hey guys pictures ensued and people shook his hand and got his autograph and the best part for me was he drew on my phone although nobody will believe that demitri martin drew on my phone so i will be battling for that story this coming school year i'd like to talk about something that i've noticed that i think is despicable we all know that the elderly are not as acute as they once were if you they don't remember things it's you know it's just how it is and sometimes they get a little bit confused a good example of this is when my brother asked my grandma for battlefield two for christmas and she got him battlefront two which is okay cause they're both good games it's an easy mistake to make this is completely innocent the games just happen to be titled similarly but some companies have gone out of their way to make products that imitate other products to confuse grandmothers a case in point i was at the store the other day and at the end of the checkout counter where they always put the little weird toy things on sale was a movie everybody's familiar with pixar's up there's a whew poster for it there that's what up looks like and then this movie was called what's up and i'm not okay with that because the covers look similar they're titled similarly who's to know what's the real product if you're not really familiar with it so i've decided that is very bad and there should be laws against it get to work on it obama it's just dawning on me that i actually haven't spoke about how the gathering went yet um it was phenomenal i had loads of fun and i hope everybody else did too and i just wanted to thank everybody who was there there were more people than we could've ever anticipated that was fantastic ah we're planning for next year already and we'll get that information out as soon as we can to allow ample time for traveling preparations to be made because you want to be there you want to be there okay here's another gripe i went in to get my school schedule yesterday and i noticed that there are a lot of classes on there that i didn't forecast for and some of them are classes that i had completed freshman year which i thought was strange so i went to the schedule changing station and i said what's up guys and apparently three of the media classes that i had forecasted for did not exist i'm just confused why would they put them in the catalogue if they weren't real they're like decoy classes i'm not i don't know why they would try to trick me but apparently what happened was not enough kids signed up for those classes which was unfortunate because that was like half my schedule so i to get that whole mess reworked but in the end it was fine and now i get to sleep in every other day because i have a first period open and now to end on a sad note one of my favorite youtubers lamar also known as wilson tech has shut down everything internet related and i have not been able to contact in any way but if he still watches these videos lamar this is for you good bye and best wishes i hope that i'll get a job at subway in chicago and maybe i'll see you someday all right that's it bye,,997
634,hello faculty of business and law especially milanese's law school crew my name is uh and this video is here like is my audition of the uni your voice video now a little bit about myself i'm third year leeds math student studying law and it's going pretty well you know in typical student style you know the work is piling up to about what this high no i'm exaggerating but um yeah it's getting tough so really important year so i'm just trying my best just doing the best that i can but also i do other things both on the law side and on the business side as well which is quite interesting um first of all um i've been doing since the first year street law and uh if you're wondering what street law is it's basically a group of us go around to many different colleges different schools and even did my first for the university itself and doing presentations on certain legal topics that might affect that particular group my last presentation was in roundhay school and we did one on worker's awareness and that was in my second year and it was pretty good you know the kids were fine they didn't misbehave or anything and that school it's actually quite pretty big it actually reminds me of heatonly so yeah and um secondly i'm also doing business data workshop i'm not presenting it i'm actually attending it some tips on how maybe being self employed could be a potential career option and i'm seriously considering it it sounds very exciting yet very risky so that's going good i think the next one is actually today at two o'clock i think it's about ironically enough legal issues so that would be quite interesting and also on the business side i'm also part of a team in the ibm university business challenge which is basically a nationwide challenge throughout many like a good couple hundred maybe on three hundred universities competing and doing business simulations i have certain ideas about we're like consultants trying to run a business and it's going pretty good um we just had the photo shoot think the other day think few days ago and um something quite funny happened i'm not going to go into detail on that but let's just say someone didn't actually come in properly dressed that's all i'm going to say for that i don't want to embarrass the person in question so um in my spare time i actually funny enough do things like this you know if you check me i'm also known on youtube as and on youtube i just do various different blogs and reports i do an extract of i might put some stuff on annotations and stuff so you can see it but um yeah that's what i do in my spare time and why do i want to be part of this faculty video well first of all it seems like a lot of fun i mean now i do this just in my room on my own it would be good to take up a notch maybe do something that's part of the university and maybe interview maybe outside the rose bowl in the main square that would be pretty fun and maybe for my own personal youtube videos i dunno it's also a potential maybe job or career option uh being cause it's some kind of job you know the key thing for me in life is to look forward to monday mornings you know be out there be like yes monday time for work and it's it's a big dream don't get me wrong but it's a dream none the less so that's the that's the main thing i wanna say hopefully it's not too long but i'm hoping i'm not too late i know this e mail came out a few weeks back so i hope i'm too late i've just been busy i didn't get around to doing this now so hopefully that master class will help me build my confidence up at well cause people say i'm quite quiet and people don't see me talk and do out outish things and stuff so hopefully i'll get through so i'll see you guys soon and uh,,722

637,i'm on holiday this week um the company i work for is currently on strike which is all over the news anyway um you know luckily the public is starting to realize what really is going on um you know there's some support there it's kind of um it's all been sort of orchestrated by high level people i can't go into too much because it's a bit political and um obviously i work for them so i'm not gonna sort of go on about it but i think this is th th this the news has been really funny all day alright but just a minute ago apparently due to the postal strikes cause the swine flu vaccination thing started on monday i think they hadn't received all the doses they was expecting due to the postal strikes please we don't deliver vaccines what what that's just they just said that on the news and i'm like oh they might have to ring people with severe illnesses to let them come in for the vaccine because of the postal strike and i'm like if anything that's probably a good thing for the public because if anyone has the vaccine it's not the best move um obviously you've got freedom of speech and it's down to you as an individual and if you want to take the vaccine take the vaccine but um i don't see that as a problem the other thing is um last night we've got a party in this country we've got a few parties we've got conservative party labour party green party lib dems i think there's a legalize cannabis party there used to be the raving looney party and then oh what's the other one um there's the british national party which is the bnp which is the one that um was deemed racist still is a bit well it is quite a lot to be honest it's even against gay people you know and not just racist um and there's another one um that's something to do with the united kingdom i can't british independent i think it's called anyway the bnp were on this program called question time which is on bbc where basically the public can ask questions because they've got more seats they were allowed on it and there was a riot outside bbc saying don't show this man on telly because um he's racist and whatever else now because we live in quite a diverse country england we've got every race possible here um you know after the war a lot of different cultures were brought over to this country etcetera etcetera and obviously the second and third generations are here there's also a lot of asylum seekers um people who have immigrated from eastern bloc and things like that and they're not bad polish really but most of the polish work and try and sort of make their own sort of sit on benefit asylum seekers piss me off because they're the sort of people who come over here oh my god you know my life's so shit er er i need to come to your country and then try and change our country to how shit their country is that doesn't make any sense to me but he was on telly and i'm not really a supporter of him but he did make a couple of true statements in some respects about how the muslim faith is perceived in the sense of um that women are second class citizens in that faith that if you're not of muslim faith then you're an infidel or something he referred to a few things there that you know um a lot of english people relate to you know when in rome do as the romans do i have absolutely no problem with what someone's culture is but just don't enforce it upon me because if i wanted to live in a say indian culture i'd go to india and live i wouldn't move to india because i couldn't be who i am because their culture i'd have to respect it so that's the only problem i have with race um but some people see that as racist apparently i think everyone's racist to some extent aren't they in the middle of a crisis if you had a load of black people and a load of chinese people and a load of white people you'd find that if there was some kind of something happened between the two cultures they'd blame the other culture and stick together it's human nature i think even animals do it this doesn't mean you're racist it's when you're aggressive toward stop smiling in the background hello um who's this what's the other thing what was on the news as well oh the weather forecast please get what what right today he's quite normal no chem trails quite warm for october twenty third to be honest apparently it's going to be fourteen degrees tonight you know it's been above three every night this week there's gonna be fourteen degrees tonight excuse me and there's torrential rain on its way that's gonna get the whole of england and then from tomorrow there's gonna be this effect of wind that's doing this this big fucking either tornado that's getting quicker and quicker in the middle that looks like a tornado oh and gale force winds and torrential rain and a weather warning to finish it you know sorry but that was a bit of a weird weather forecast seriously if you get a chance check it today cause it was just like what do you know what i mean so and then in leeds right the post office are on strike the bin men are on strike what was the other thing south yorkshire the firemen there oh yeah the firemen are on strike it's like okay um what was the other thing oh yeah the land revenue i think in norfolk maybe going on strike or to industrial action if something isn't sorted out to do with job loss uk's recession seeks supplantive culture of economal economical decline our gdp has plummeted by naught point four percent and therefore it's gonna rise right you know i've been going on to everyone we're not out of no there's no financial collapse has happened yet just wait cause it's gonna be fucking horrendous right all this bullshit they've done has done nothing which we all knew it would do nothing and now it's all escalating watch it escalate more and more and more and more i've gotta go i've gotta work work four days a week now for the next however it is until they stop fucking striking i personally still think we should just take royal mail's mail out and bollocks to the others to the regulator you know at the end of the day i think the nearer to christmas it comes i think postmen might even do that um i don't know but yeah it's all a bit of a mess um i don't know if there's anything else is there anything else that's gone on this week i don't think so it's just all it's the first time i've seen the sky for four days it's all like autumny look you can see that we're going into the shortest area look you see all the autumn autumn look my car is over there see my van and my c my wire and my car the silver and the white one i've got my car there now look the sky has kind of not got anything in it no chem trails no nothing it's quite nice and pleasant out there and there's a breeze oh a nice freight train going by so thanks let's see what they're going out of a redland aggregates they're not making as much money that train was half the size they usually are oh another one i feel like a trains bar do i look like one sorry did you say yes don't look at me like that look youtube i've got a bed now a double bed look wow look yeah i got a new double bed today yeah yeah yeah um um what else there's not really much going on actually i wasn't i dunno anyone remember the new world game cards um that were quite sort of if you looked at them you'd think oh cause they're quite similar to some events that have occurred um but there was one that said pandemics economical collapse civil unrest natural disasters oh there's been another earthquake in indonesia today that would be the what third more than that more there's been more than that there must have been four or five earthquakes in the last four or five weeks what you what you know what i mean six point and seven point and eight what they're not small earthquakes uh i don't know you know maybe back to report something over the weekend i'll let you know what the tornado is like that was approaching us that no one seems it looks like a tornado you know obviously it isn't well it's a slim possibility government focuses growth by the end of the year at what growth from what service sector behind unexpected economy only economy thing is gonna rise by the end of the yeah because of christmas there'll be a surge of people who buy things which will put the gdp up of course it will everyone spends at least a fucking thousand pound at christmas so you know do the maths sixty six million people spending a thousand pound each quite a lot of money there's gonna be a peak and then it's gonna go swoosh as everyone can't pay back their credit then by march oh dear are we fucked so yeah um yeah quite interesting then over in england it's a bit sort of em yeah anyways sort of like i'm gonna go now cause i think ten minutes and i've blogged about absolutely nothing i think but then i'm just not here i gotta go back to work on monday they're on strike today but yeah at least i'm not suffering having next week off i'm a postal worker i work indoors um doing special deliveries and apparently we're striking next saturday so that's great it's ten hour shift though that i don't have to do means i only get paid for thirty hours but i've got

638,hey guys how's it going i am going to make a video because i am frustrated at something something that i'm really really feeling guilty of something i'm guilty of and it kind of goes all around the world of everyone being guilty of this i work at a place i'm not going to say the name i work in this place where i make coffee and i serve doughnuts and i do drive through we make sandwiches it's just a nice place and its good and it's very famous in canada i have issues with some customers and the way they do things so the first one is talking to us like we are idiots we have brains we know we know what you want you just have to explain it better or speak louder if we ask you to repeat something it's not because we want you to change your words around and say oh let me put this in layman terms for you like i had that when i was on drive through they weren't speaking very loud so i asked politely could you please repeat your order and then they start talking to me like i'm this idiot just like this some people when i'm at the drive through window and i check out what their order is and i look at the price of what it is and i go like hi it's this amount please and then normally i just stick my hand out and they slap it in my hand okay there are sometimes when people just dump it on the counter like the window ledge counter when my hand is right there out it's like hi my hand's here you can put it in my hand but no would you like me to hand you your coffee the same way just oh oh i thought you were going to catch that oops another thing is when there some customers who think that i can change the store like moving around where the air vents are or where the tables are that are stuck to the ground or how everything is laid out yes because i am at the bottom of the food chain of our working company like our working line and you are me asking me to figure out how to fix it that's gonna work this one lady came in and her complaint was really funny it was i just sat on your garbage cans outside and i got gum stuck to my pants why were you sitting on the garbage can i had to hold it together cause i was gonna burst out laughing that was an interesting one but i mean there are things that we do as workers that are good like i'm really good i've gotten really high marks in like customer service so i try to please people as much as i can i'm just a people pleaser it's what i do i've i've gotten so mad at people i work with who are just being rude it's just it's unnecessary for us to be rude to them even if you're having a stressful day i mean everyone comes in expecting good service and i think that we should give them good service some people i don't think realize how stressed out um you can get when you working in just a fast food restaurant and how how it is it's a hard job people think like oh flipping burgers whatever no it's a lot of standing on you feet for a long time and remembering certain things of how to make things and all the stuff and it's it's a hard job it's not easy um and we get constantly we get stepped on by rude people who just i guess don't understand and i was just i don't know today i just feeling like you know what something needs to be said because i'm sick of being stepped on i'm sick of being spat on i just want to be able to do my job and if i could reach out to one person please say thank you please say please it just makes our day better trust me those two words just please and thank you make everything so much better and if we make a mistake a slight mistake like in the order taking and we say oh we'll fix it and we're doing it for free don't yell at us cause we're fixing it for free because we are the ones who made the mistake we're human we are not robots and we kinda make mistakes i don't know i just wanted to give a little shout out to the underdogs in all of the working industry i guess yeah so i have decided that i really want to make videos more and more so i'm trying to think of things to talk about and this one seemed to stand out today so let me know what you think tell me if you're insulted cause i just insulted a bunch of customers who do those things or you could tell me about your experiences on the other side or on my side so let me know if you've ever worked in a place like that or if you had like a really really rude person behind the counter giving you your order because i have seen them where i work but only a couple most of us are super super nice ugh i get mad when people are rude behind the counter too because there is no way there's no reason for it really whatever okay well i'll talk to you guys later bye,,954

644,so this is a quick blog to test out the new auto captions feature a warning to you all is that it is going to suck a bit because there will be no background noise and i am reading this as a transcript that i can upload later on and see how accurately google can time code tags to make this text file into a captions file i am interested in finding out how well it matches the text to what i'm saying i want to see if it works for accents that aren't american and how it splits up the text of course i also have some questions for the good folk at youtube first up when will machine captioning become available to more users as someone who uses captions a lot i would love to get my hands on this feature and i think i can offer some good feedback so perhaps youtube could consider users like myself if they are going to roll it out for channels the second thing is of course when will these be made available in other languages obviously if this feature were to become available in japanese that would be a huge help to all the japanese language students out there there are several videos explaining this feature here right here and here the long one is a bit of a chore but the explanations seems to indicate that the main audience that they're thinking of is the hearing impaired this might be followed by more people perhaps interested in translated captions which is more my area of interest my more precise area of focus is even more specialized than this it is making captions for students of language which is why i make all my captions bilingual this means i have other features that i want to see like the ability for people to download caption files to read and study and the ability to collaboratively make and upload captions to other people's channels for now i just want to see how this works so make sure your captions are turned on below and see what you think of the syncing peace,,361
645,hey everybody how's it going it has been quite a while since i have done this uh and i'm sorry about that you know what i'm actually sorry for you that i keep saying sorry for shit umm seems like anything that i do i take long hiatuses on i just my attention span is very very small uh even with things i like and speaking of things i like here i have a new game plan for christian's vlog um i just don't seem to have it in me to be ah be witty and have some kind of idea and themes to each different vlog um the ones i did before you know they were fun but i just that much production going into it not that it was spielberg but you know transitions and fancy stuff i just don't really have the time for anymore but i still kinda wanna put things out so what i was thinking of doing was sticking to something that i could pretty much turn out pretty quickly and it doesn't take much work and i think people will enjoy it um so i'm gonna stick to what i know and that's music as you can see if you can only see this side it's uh music crazy with lots of gear anyways um so yeah that's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna start playing tunes instead of getting drunk and filming it that was fun but i've done it so i don't need to do it again umm so that's what i'm gonna do i'm gonna take requests but here's the catch to give me a little bit of control over what i do rather than just randomly taking requests so that i don't get you know some ridiculous songs um i'm gonna take requests by year so people can say you know nineteen seventy six and i have to pick a song from nineteen seventy six to play or nineteen eighty five or nineteen thirty two you know obviously the farther back you go it'll get a little more fun for me to try to find something to do but anyways that's what i'm gonna do so put your requests in down in the comments umm it's i i don't think it's gonna be like whoever comments first that's not what i'm gonna do i think i'll just randomly pick one um to give everybody a chance cause there's people who and you know who you are will probably watch this very quickly like as soon as i put it out and there's people who won't see it for a week so i want to give everybody a chance to that wants to to uh put uh jesus i'm just losing track of what i'm talking about here alright i'm good um i want everybody to have a chance to put in a request for a year i'm sure most people start with their birth year but then once you get past that you know it's kinda fun ta to you know hear me do a tune that's from the forties or you know something like that and of course being me i'm not just gonna i'll probably be doing them acoustic um cause you know there's only one of me um so it'll be fun and of course i'm going to do them in my own style so even if it is from the forties i might you know try to do something else with it but anyways that's what i'm doing that's what this vlog is going to be from now on maybe i'll pepper in you know some kind of goofy one once in a while but for now the these are the type of vlogs that i can handle doing and putting out hopefully on a semi regular basis so thank you for everyone who has subscribed hopefully um you won't umsub you won't um you won't umsubscribe you won't unsubscribe just because i'm only doing music now but uh at least it's more interactive everybody likes music and i will take a stab at different years so comment and thank you for watching and uh have a pleasant day evening wherever you are year okay that's it,,712

647,so when i was thinking about videos that i could do for my youtube page i was actually considering doing a video about a child that my family and i sponsor in ethiopia but then i went to the page and they were talking about project for awesome two thousand and eight and i thought it was a perfect opportunity for me to talk about this charity the charity i have chosen to talk about is called compassion a lot of people are talking about how they're suffering and because of the economic turmoil that canada the u s the whole entire world is going through right now and even though that is true we have to take a step back and realize that there are people all around the world who are suffering far mean children mainly because they really can't do much for themselves so on their website you can pick a child deciding on what gender you want the age the country they live in it it really doesn't matter or you can ask for them to send you a random child in the mail that you can sponsor for thirty five dollars a month now that's the canadian price i have absolutely no idea what it is in other countries because they are situated round the world so you would have to go to the specific website for your country to find out how much it is to sponsor a child the story about how my family actually decided to sponsor a child is pretty interesting i was in tenth grade and i went to a concert for a christian singer i really like called rebecca saint james and i went with my dad and we were pretty close we were like in the fourth row or something like that and she was talking about how her and her home and her family sponsored children through compassion and i don't know just the way she was describing it and how she actually went over there and got to see how her money and other people's money were being put to good use it just touched me and i really like i couldn't obviously i couldn't afford it because i was fifteen at the time i just really asked my dad if um we could sponsor this child so she asked the audience to raise your hand if you wanted like a little portfolio thingy for a child and uh i raised our hand and we got this child called senit here she is also on the sheet it explains where exactly your money is going so it says that it helps provide your sponsored child with medical checkups clothing recreational activities tutoring tuition and scholastic materials so i thought that was really great that you know exactly where your money's going and what is being provided for your child so you know that he or she is going to be well taken care of so there we go i told you a little bit about compassion what they do and you know even if you if you can't afford to make any sort of donation or even sponsor a child maybe you know somebody who can and or you can try and raise awareness about it too now i really want the thumbnail to show up for so i'm going to just have the next a minute a minute to two minutes of the thumbnail in hopes that it'll let me pick it so the video's ending now thank you for listening,,596
648,hey youtube or just like the couple of people who watch me on this but that's cool too hey guys um i was tagged for this um harry potter survey in like october two thousand and eight and i did not do it and i have not done it and now i am doing it now okay and there's gonna be rapid fire and there's gonna be crazy and spastastic because i am going to try and do it all in one take and as you guys know i cannot edit because if anybody out there knows what editing system works with the coolpix nikon coolpix p four br i dunno what all those things mean but coolpix in this is not the reason i'm posting this i'm posting this because i want to talk about harry potter cause who doesn't wanna do that so i've got my list of questions and i've got some post it notes and some crayons so let's get down to business shall we okay let's do this um let's just fair warning right now i am probably going to start every question with why are you making me answer this question because it is physically and mentally and emotionally impossible okay number one what is your favorite wizard rock band why are you making me answer this question um it really depends on my mood um uh if i if i really wanna dance or something i'll listen to ministry of magic um the parcelmouths um pretty much those guys i just love dancing to their music and but if i'm feeling really really fan girly and really romantic kind of mood i'll listen to mudbloods or i'll listen to roon roonil wazlib la la i cannot speak because i'm trying to do this really fast um neville's diary i want to give a shout out to him because i think he is adorable and yeah that's all i can think of right off the top of my head next question doodle yoo how did you get into wizard rock which is number two i got into wizard rock uh i think in my junior year of high school i'm a senior that's right it's at the end of senior year and or before that i'm not exactly sure but my friend margaret and i she really is the one that got me into it she said have you heard of harry and the potters so i said no who are these they're they sound amazing because they have to do with harry potter and she showed me their myspace and i got really excited and then i clicked on his friends and then their friends and then their friends and then team hoyt and i just kind of swapped notes on who was cool and then it just kind of rolled into this big ball of awesome wizard rock and it so happy it happened thank you team hoyt for showing me harry and the potters because it never would've gotten as awesome as it is now okay yeah number three have you ever been to a wizard rock concert yeah i have i've only been to one i'm lame and but i mean at least i've gone to one right right and i have their signature my post it is folding um it had the whomping willows and uh symatma jockmill and then uh justin flinch fletchley and the sugar quills and uh catchlove so i have all their signatures on the back of a shirt but since i'm being really quick and random with this video i won't move from this spot cause i don't want this to be over five minutes and if it is i am very sorry about that wizard rock concerts are super fun and i need to go to more before i die okay most played wizard rock song on your ipod i think it was save ginny weasley i've listened to that one a lot probably because it's the first wizard rock song i've ever heard uh that was a really good song by harry and the potters um i think a close second was uh accio love by ministry magic number five if you had a wizard rock band what would it be called yes um i decided cause i have made a wizard rock song but it was really more like the mournings of mourning of being a muggle and how much it sucks being a muggle when it like it does if you knew about the wizarding world kinda like petunia did but from my point of view and how i wish i could operate and how i wish that i could have a spell check quill before it goes bad and starts making ronald weasley come out roonil wazlid um anyways i would've called it uh uh faith trust and nargle like faith trust in pixie dust isn't that what tinkerbell says but then end it with the nargles which i don't know if that's stupid or clever ha ha you make up your mind put it in the comment side six i think i'm on six are you a nerd fighter yes i am a nerd fighter ooh ah that was a quick one um when did you get into wizard rock i think i already answered that um junior year pretty sure junior year correct me if i'm wrong but i think you got into it just a little bit before me because you were

650,who in their right mind actually uses these things hey argh i have just filmed seven minutes worth of me talking and it has just disappeared off the face of the earth i'm not happy i'm not happy whatsoever but i do have something still to talk about now yeah firstly um i'm trying to make it sound like i have many things to say but i really don't to start with it's about the same thing um right so last video i suggested that i could use some of your suggestions for my next video um to be honest they weren't that impressive uh the best one was from paul uh he said i should interview my band uh which i will do when i'm with them sometime soon i'm only with them once a week um so i'm not too sure when but it will happen i promise if it sees this um it's my sister's but i only put it on um to cover up my greasy bad hair which you can see is bad already ew hob nobs they look fresh okay ooh but this whole interview thing could be a good idea to get famous you never know gibo nineteen eighty eight uh he is he still on youtube i haven't looked i guess to me but he he used to make um interviews where the you tube is and it was good he think he got kind of a lot of fans out of that i i came across someone i used to subscribe to on my old channel um he was a presenter on the children's bbc in the past and then he's come all under great internet things uh he's on uh a channel called mr holy moly and pocket tv show and he's quite published he's quite famous i i like him i want to be him he met mr t randomly and got to interview mr t i want to do that one day he would probably be dead by that time but i still want to do it just the grave mr t so um how's the a team really good and skype is jumping up and down at me but i'm not going to click it because the last time i went off this recording thing on imovie it went off so you have to wait for me someone whoever it is here's another thing um last video was a bit bad because i did it on imovie hd and the settings i used for it didn't save so i had to readjust them but i didn't do it properly so it kind of changed some of the settings but the rest didn't connect with that one so it's all out of tune with each other so it's all pixeley and the quality was not that good hopefully imovie zero nine will do this better hopefully on bass i'm trying to learn all the frets uh from what notes to play so i can adjust to new songs and automatically know what chords to play at what bit and where it is on the fret board but it does take some time for example there's no such thing as an e sharp it goes e f um i wasn't kind of aware of that at the time so i was like what what's with the gun or a b sharp either what yeah we're writing some more originals when we meet up we've got two so far uh hopefully we can get three by the end of the week as usual i'll keep you updated right i'm going to go now because i think i've i've done an adequate amount of footage to whittle down into a smaller internet screen where you can see me and uh it's been eight minutes so it's going to take a while to edit but i'll do it anyway i i'll see you in two days,,664
651,we're going to deal with the subject of islam uh it has come to my attention that obviously you have a wide range of understanding of the key apologetic issues amongst the muslim people some have little to no understanding at all and and some are a little more read uh but when it comes to popular islam it seems that the most popular name today is zakir naik now he of course as we have demonstrated in previous videos is pretty much just continuing ah the work of ahmed deedat his arguments are sometimes word for word identical to ahmed deedat and what concerns me is i don't see a lot of evidence that doctor naik has gone beyond ahmed deedat um especially in the fact that well many people have demonstrated that ahmed deedat made many fundamental basic errors that really um for a serious christian make his apologetics um well significantly less than compelling shall we say might be the nicest way to put it uh bogus would be the more modern way of putting it uh we have documented many of uh ahmed deedat's errors in the past on this youtube channel um but dr zakir naik continues to use the same type of argumentation and basically goes like this you say jesus never said i am god worship me um then you run through an entire list of out of context verses and you do it really really fast so that you are really impressing um the muslim audience but not the christian audience that actually knows their scriptures now if you're talking to a christian that doesn't know their bible they can be totally blown away by someone who can just pull verses very very quickly of course anybody can do that with a koran too and i suppose in that way uh impress muslims who don't know their scriptures very well but from a christian perspective that wouldn't be an appropriate thing to do that would not honor allah the truth would it because that's sort of what politicians do not what people who are dealing with god's truth do and so i was directed recently to the appearance of zakir naik on the deen show now we have interacted with the deen show before i realized when i was starting to look at this that i never finished one series i was doing when i was going through the top ten reasons why jesus isn't god it's amazing how much time uh the deen show spends on well attacking christianity um rather than other things but maybe that's just because that's what i'm directed to you know i could that could be a possibility um i i will leave that out there that's something that is a possibility but they do do it a lot and in this clip this session with zakir naik first thing they go for is that particular subject but in the process dr zakir naik once again demonstrates that neither he nor ahmed deedat actually understand the doctrines of trinity uh they do not understand the presentation of the doctrine they do not understand historically they do not understand it biblically and if zakir naik is the best known islamic apologist what does that say shouldn't the best known islamic apologist at least be accurate in his statements concerning the doctrine of the trinity wouldn't just simple truth and honesty and even just respect require that i i think it would so we're going to look at what zakir naik had to say and provide a response and um once again i would love to see someone arrange an opportunity to debate zakir naik um maybe over more than one night because there are some very important topics to address and it would be very useful i think to find out can this man actually go beyond the speed reading of verses and actually deal with the text as it was originally written against someone who knows that text well that's what i would like to find out i would be honored to have that opportunity of defending the gospel of jesus christ in that context we would be very happy to see that happen so let's take a look at um zakir naik we start uh with the host of the program seems like a really nice guy eddie um wouldn't want to mess with him seems like a pretty big guy guess he's into martial arts and stuff like that um but he notice his description of zakir naik as the doctor of dawa i'm not just the one saying here is the big man this this should be the most accurate presentation that we find that's what the muslims themselves are saying let's take a look at it by popular demand people have been requesting people have been asking why don't you have this man on the show and you know what today he's here the true doctor abdawa doctor zakir naik when we come back you don't want i mean yes so we're going to get straight to the topic there's some confusion out there people are worshiping the sun they're worshiping the moon they're worshiping a man so in this particular show because you're expert on this topic we want to give the top reasons why the creator of the heavens and the earth god almighty in arabic we say allah is not a man never was a man never tried to be a man if you analyze uh all the major religion of the world except for islam all the other major religions of the world they believe that almighty god became a human being once or a number of times yes all the major religions except islam they believe that almighty god either once or many times became a human being and they believe in a philosophy knows as anthropomorphism uh huh anthropomorphism means that almighty god taking forms and he becomes a human being and then we ask them why does almighty god have to become a human being so they say that almighty god he's so holy he's so pure he's so noble he does not know the shortcomings of the human being uh huh he does not know how they make me feel when he's hurt when he's angry when it requires certain things he doesn't know the requirements of the human being how do they feel et cetera that's the reason almighty god came into this world and became a human being to know what is good or what is bad for the human being uh huh on the face of it it sounds to be a very good logic oh almighty god so holy so pure so noble does not know the shortcomings of the human being does not know how human being feels when he is hurt when he has problems so it sounds to be good yeah and i tell them that suppose i had been to manufacture a dvd player yeah i created a dvd player but because i'm a manufacturer for dvd player do i have to become a dvd player to know what is good or what is bad for the dvd player how is it because i am the manufacturer i'm the creator i don't have to become a dvd player what do i do i write the instruction manual exactly but if you want to play the dvd inside the dvd and then press the play button yes if you want to skip press the skip button if you want to stop press the stop button i don't have to become a dvd player to know what is good or the bad for the dvd player because i am the creator similarly almighty god he is the creator of the human being so he does not have to become a human being to know what is good or the bad for the human being what does he do he chooses a man amongst men and he communicates with them on a higher level who we call a messenger he doesn't have to come himself and the last and final message the last and final instruction manual for the man is the koran now this wasn't really the central aspect of my concerns about what doctor naik says uh however i've never argued that the incarnation is based upon god needing to know what it's like to be a man um that's not a biblical presentation the necessity of the incarnation really has to do with god's decree and with the means by which forgiveness of sins is provided and that is through the sacrifice of christ and the union of god's people with christ those are all important things but it's not god needed to know what it's like to be a man that's just not a biblical presentation and so i have to wonder who it is that eddie is talking about or that zakir naik is talking about when he talks about people uh saying these things that uh well god needed to become a man so he could know what it's like to be a man um that's just simply not a christian perspective uh at this point then doctor naik goes into his how many completely out of context verses can i fire off at you very very quickly so as to impress your routine and so we're going to listen to this so you can get the effect you can understand you know um why someone who is ignorant of the bible might find this to be very uh impressive or weighty uh but then look at the text and see that doctor naik is not dealing with the bible in any kind of serious fashion uh but is just giving uh uh uh a standard form of of argumentation now tell us now it's known commonly that people take wanda is beloved to our hearts when we love him as one of the mightiest messengers of god the many are claiming that he said he was god that he's,,1697
652,okay this is part two of my anarchy q and a session says i vote for capitalism which like democracy is a horribly flawed system that happens to be the best thing we can come up with at the moment however even capitalism is starting to show its flaws like the social ones i seriously doubt capitalism will survive another fifty years at current rates of technological development we're perilously close to technologies capable of surpassing the abilities with respect to the specific jobs of most of the morons in our population my response capitalism is nothing more than the non interference of the government in the market and that transactions within a market should be voluntary how is capitalism showing its flaws as far as i can discern the market trash the market crash was the market trash er the market crash was triggered by fannie mae and freddie mac which were both government er started initiatives they were private at the time but the government took them told them to give loans to people who could not afford to have houses in the first place the government told them that uh they would have their back in anything went wrong and look at look at them look at where we are now erm says i assume jobs similar to phone tech support cellphone operators drive thru restaurant workers will be among the first to go as more and more people are displaced even more pronounced socialist welfare estate will likely spring up take care for the masses and morons that are literally surpassed intellectually by the machines thankfully this imposes no burden at all on the society as most of the jobs necessary to provide basic resources for this displaced part of the workforce will also be replaced by machines erm yeah i guess that's sort of a complicated problem you know as a philosopher i am thinking of dealing of ways to deal with the economy post singularity but that's that's not really the current issue right now i believe that if machines did everything the world would be like utopia we wouldn't have to worry about food and work and we could just do whatever we wanted i mean that sounds great doesn't it unless there's some sort of dark side but that that's kind of a different problem anyways says but hey reduced government right now would be good along with fewer laws against things that are nobody's business unless government meddling is business hey even though capitalism is going to drive itself in the ground eventually that doesn't mean it's not the right thing now erm i'm saying my response is why reduce the government when you say that freedom causes disaster or are you saying it didn't okay i'm just gonna answer a few comments now nodayde wrote i love the way statist assumes that it's up to you to give up your home and life you've built for yourself if you object to government extortion and thuggery um isaac fineman fineman wrote erm you mean the home and life you built amongst the living held of statist tyrant tyranny and here i thought you saw statism as a real problem but apparently you don't see it as a bad enough to even warrant moving to escape it when one contrasts your attitude with those of people who've lived in real statist societies like nazi germany and soviet union who risked their lives to leave i think we got a sense of the degree to which we should take your views seriously i wrote let's say for example you've lived in a place for a long time a nice neighborhood and you've built a house and generated wealth and a life for yourself then a group of thugs came into your neighborhood and demanded money for protection and forced you to pay for it at gunpoint do you feel you should be the one who has to leave this group of thugs doesn't disrupt your life too much they just come by weekly to demand protection money to protect you from another worse gang two miles away who would rather otherwise charge more protection money how is that how how does how's wanting to stay in the same place legitimizing this sort of behavior anyways got another comment from sorianer practicality is abandoned for a higher moral intellectual ideal or a more specifically your higher moral ideal so i'm being asked to abandon potential comfort for your morals uh something said no i'm asking you to stop legitimizing the use of force against people for acceptance of it is what gives it power and make sure you vote sarcasm sorianer says if absolutely no use of force against people is legitimate then there's no way to address people that act to counter society now just as a clarification an anarchist is against the initiation force so we have no problem with you know obtaining property that was stolen from us because that's sort of self defense initiation of the force is the problem starting you know starting aggression on someone is a problem that's what we have a problem with and it's not just force it's the initiation of force anyways louden theogen says the states is immoral crazypants eighty eight says the state is funded through taxes which is extracted with a death threat what i mean is that if you wouldn't pay your taxes you would be imprisoned if you fight back you'd be killed anarchism one o one i'm going to explain the concept of monopoly monopoly is when a company is allowed by law to force everyone to pay for their particular service microsoft is not a monopoly coca cola is not a monopoly because they do not own one hundred percent of their sector in the market and they cannot force you to pay for their particular services the only organization that has a monopoly is the government because the government has the power and apparently the right to force you to pay for their particular services you do not get to choose who you pay for to pave the roads to pay for your or to provide hydro protection et cetera et cetera you have to pay it it's mandatory to pay for this particular service and that's what a monopoly is and that's why monopolies are bad because if you are forced to pay for a particular service whether or not it's good there's no incentive to provide a good service cause you are paying it anyways regardless of how shitty it is and that's why government services are shitty says if you want so bad to defend anarchists suggest that you explain in detail how you do better than the police to fight organized crime then how you do better than the army to deal with threatening and strong states or you can just blame sceptics for thinking that mafias terrorists and selfishness still exist under the wonderful ideal society that is anarchy my response does the police fight crime or cause crime in the us one in a hundred people are imprisoned and many of them are imprisoned for a victimless crime of drug possession i see the police as committing the crime here unjustly incarcerating and brutalizing thousands upon thousands for drug possession who owns your body do you or does the government own your body if you believe in self ownership then you believe that you have the right to consume what foods you want even if they are in an unhealthy you have the right to get tattoos even if other people find them distasteful and he has a right to do drugs because the only person being affected when you smoke a joint is you furthermore the reason the reason gangs and crime syndicates exist is because certain things people want are illegal such as drugs there is a market for drugs this is why there's people you know they exist the black market to provide it for example in prohibition the mafia gang er gained enormous strength and affluence by smuggling the alcohol and gangs ran entire cities and ran rampant in society alcohol is a drug when they relegalized it alcohol again these gangs lost much of their power we don't see budweiser and molson canadians shooting it out in the streets over territory and the gang violence over drugs will cease if drugs were were were just legalized also the police don't defend citizens against crime they rarely catch a criminal before they commit a crime or even right after they commit a crime uh the best way to to be defended is to defend yourself the police usually just swings by and picks up the bodies after the fact also to deal with strong states you can have a voluntary militia i mean switzerland does it fine i'll just read an article at any given moment forty three hundred stationary sirens sound off in switzerland indicating a foreign invasion and a nuclear holocaust within twelve hours a militia of six hundred thousand swiss men enrolled in either in aged between eighteen and forty grabbed their storm wear m fifty seven semi automatic assault rifles and army fatigue from the closets and storm out of their apartments and chalets into the front line to protect their homeland the swiss army is civilian not professional which impressed adolf hitler during world war two in a nineteen forty,,1589
653,it's been a while it's been a couple of weeks since i have posted a video i have been kind of busy with my college chum i'm making the videos for the college chum that does not mean that i have left you all high and dry you know i've kind of run out of steam you know i've been feeling real you know just blah just not knowing what to i was going to make a video okay about how to make paper airplanes okay this is the level of inspiration that's going on at the moment i i just don't know what to make videos about anymore every time i make a video i you know so i make a video i type it into the youtube search engine and there's twenty million videos made that about that subject already i'm just making excuses here you know i'm just kind of i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm going to make more videos this blond streak here is probably the most blondest part of my hair and that's a bit odd on its own um yeah so i need ideas um for videos i need ideas if you have an idea i shall make it if you build it they will come if you build it they will come yeah basically you build it and i'll come no that might be a bit wrong anyway you've got the idea,,239
654,i feel like it's been forever i've been really busy since actually i don't really know when busy actually okay i'm not busy i i just i don't know like every time it gets to be like winter and stuff like i go insane like i just i um oh yeah so the halloween party that i went to was really fun the guys planned this haunted house scavenger hunting for the girls yeah it was quite an experience i would say but we didn't like carve pumpkins or anything we were supposed to but what happened was the night before halloween we went to the grocery store to buy stuff and then we couldn't find any more that sold pumpkins after like one o'clock in the morning so we decided to um i know this is bad i don't know if i like i'm gonna get in trouble for like saying this but we went driving through the neighborhood and we actually borrowed um people's pumpkins so by the end of the night we got like fifty pumpkins and um to people who live around my neighborhood i'm sorry i mean if you're gonna freaking like put pumpkins on your front porch then who like who's not gonna steal them you know like so i'll post the pictures um i mean it's not that you wanna see them anyway but i really don't care what you guys think i'm kidding i think my hair's growing i hate having short hair like this it's so annoying like yeah it's fun for like the first month but after that like the whole growing process is just boring but then i mean if you think about it when anything grows it's pretty sucking annoying me growing as a person is freaking annoying so i mean duh wow i'm like out of it i don't know why am i making this video oh my god mmmm we have a new president of the united states huh barack obama yeah i'm so happy you don't understand like like i was watching his um speech on youtube like in chicago and i started crying like i have hope in this country i really do i don't know if you notice but i don't have bed sheets on my bed at the moment and the reason being is because my dog decided to take a piss on my bed sheets she never did it like until recently so i mean if you guys know anything about dogs can you like please tell me cause it's freaking annoying like i wake up and like in the middle of the bed and it's like freaking a yeah i'm just gonna go now i'm not gonna say anything else,,460
655,the bar i'm gonna talk about today is train bar um also called mistral bleu um it's it's in roppongi um basically to get there from roppongi crossing is you walk down towards depending on the side of the street you walk on you walk down towards either mcdonalds or donki hordo um basically it's right at mcdonalds then there's a tiny little street and then you're if you cross that tiny little street uh you see some stairs going down and train bar is is in the wall right next to those stairs uh that sounds maybe a little difficult but it's it is quite easy to find ask anyone for uh um yeah uh where mcdonalds is and uh you should pretty much see it um train bar is a rock bar uh it's really tiny it's one of the i think it's the only rock bar really in uh in roppongi at least i haven't found any else and uh i haven't heard about any else and generally there's not that many up in tokyo um so they only play rock music uh heavy rock metal um some kind of some sometimes the old rock basically anything in the rock genre um it's it's very small uh but can get very busy um in general the crowd is a little bit older uh i'd say in general people are plus thirty not saying young people don't go in they do but they definitely don't make out the majority as also in general i'm speaking in very general terms here in general the crowd is more men than women um and i think both fit just because you know uh old style rock music so it has an older crowd uh and in general in my experience at least uh rock music especially the older kind was more of a guy thing than a girl thing in very very general terms uh so that might explain it uh ironically it's a rock bar but you find a lot of high end people there uh usually people with uh with quite good jobs and even people taking out business partners for a drink in the night and stuff like that i definitely made some some very good contacts there um fights pretty much never happens uh i've heard about them one or two times never seen them and i go there a lot uh i'd say you know it's a once in a full moon uh kinda thing it'll happen maybe a small fight every year you know maybe a couple of times every year or something like that uh the crowd are usually very cool very friendly it's definitely a meet people kind of spot people are very easy to talk to um the only the one of the down sides is though that since it's so tiny it only takes one person to fuck it up for everyone else if one person is being a loud idiot who runs around doing stupid shit and is generally very annoying you can't really move away from him you know even if you go down to the other end of the bar he's still very very much you know doing stuff to your experience so that's perhaps one of the only downsides um when it gets crowded and when not i can't say when of course in general on a thursday friday saturday are more crowded than um the other days when it's open it's usually open every day sometimes sundays closed and um of course on special holidays and stuff like that it usually opens around uh five or six in the uh six or seven in the evening roughly again but that also depends it's pretty much when the owner or whoever works on that day decides they want to open staff very very cool people by the way um you will find a healthy mix of both japanese and um foreigners uh sometimes more foreigners sometimes more japanese i'd say it's roughly fifty fifty um the prices is fairly cheap compared to places in roppongi it's definitely one of the cheaper places in roppongi uh beer and such start at seven hundred yen and pretty much nothing goes over a thousand yen uh the only prices that go over a thousand yen are things like a bottle of red wine or champagne things like that uh but in general they're pretty cheap uh from five to nine thirty is happy hour or is it eight thirty now nine thirty i'm pretty sure um or is it just nine anyway you get the general nine ish uh it's happy hour which means uh all drinks are five hundred yen which is super cheap uh in roppongi so that's definitely a good spot to warm up uh they also um they have a bell that you can ring if you ring it you buy shots for everyone at the bar usually i would not recommend doing that if it's a full night um shots are usually around eight hundred yen by the way um they have a very healthy music selection and feel free to request songs go over and browse through their they have pretty much huge wall section uh for for cds you can also bring in your own cds and stuff like that as long as obviously the music kind of fits uh you won't hear any britney spears i'm sorry um the the bar has a very long history uh it's pretty much always been in the same family the owner's indian his name's roy very cool guy um and it's been his been in his family from the beginning i think it's around thirty years now and have been visited by a lot of rock bands rock crews and stuff like that after concerts and stuff like that which is a very nice to happen um they definitely have a lot of regulars oh i'd say regulars make up eighty percent of the people that are usually there there's not that many tourists because it's it's usually not in tourists uh it's usually not in tourist books uh it has been a couple of times though but in general is not uh which is a shame it's really cool um yeah so uh but i definitely you know should i rank it should i rank it from um on a on a one to ten depending on what you're in the mood for you know it would be perfect other times it's just not um i don't want to give anything a ten so i'd i'd give it an eight or nine you know pretty pretty damn good i recommend it if uh if you like rock music if you don't then it might not be so much your place anyway um so if you're in roppongi check out train

656,hey youtube um i have been thinking a lot about relationships and relations with different people um i learned a lot this summer and recently about mostly about like how different people create different relationships and how multiple different people can cause relationships to end weird or be weird i don't know i i struggle with different kinds of relationships personally ah because of the way i grew up but that's not always the case and i'm not like using it as an excuse it's more like family relationships i'm just talking about like friends um i made a mistake this summer and at that point in time it was like the best thing i thought to do and what i felt was right and maybe there was too much emotion going on ah for me personally uh it's it's it's like a like a weird tricky balance that you is hard to to deal with sometimes i don't really i don't know i struggle with relationships every day of my life it's cause they take work and i it takes a lot of guts and a lot of want to fix something after you broke it intentionally unintentionally whatever um cause sometimes people make mistakes and they're not quite sure why and they didn't or they didn't think it was a mistake at the time um like my brother called me yesterday and it sounded like he wanted a different i have an older brother who i have negative and positive emotions towards and he sounded like he wanted to um like build a relationship again i guess or like he needed something from me he wanted something from me but i didn't really feel like i needed to give that to him cause i wasn't sure it was and i don't really have very many emotions for him i guess now and maybe i'm not ready uh and so even when it comes to friends i i learned a lot about what kind of friends i want and what kinds i need and what kinds i don't uh and i'm not opposed to owning up to my mistakes that's not the issue it's more like i don't know just not getting other people to understand mistakes and like being able to explain where you were coming from and cause to me to emotions get wrapped up in it uh i don't know it's hard it's like you don't know how much effort you should put forth for a relationship of any kind um most most right now i'm talking about friendships because i i had a group of friends this summer that i did something that i didn't view as necessarily wrong and it just started to get disbanded and then apparently i got distant i mean what really happened is i just started spending more time with other people or i was working full time i mean that's the other thing that happened i don't know i just get super confused and it it does take a lot of guts just to you know call someone up and be like yes what i did wrong um and then you have to weigh out if that's really necessary but i mean honestly i guess another good way to think about something or anything in life is what do you really have to lose usually you don't have anything to lose because you've already lost it or you never had it before in the beginning anyway but it's just sort of like having enough courage to i don't know um go about that and actually go and do it is the hardest part and that's kind of what i'm trying to figure out now it's like who's who's most of my relationships actually it's like what is the pro and con of of me you know putting myself out there and like trying this because more often than not it's not going to be the the outcome that i want and like i do miss people and i may have messed up but it's like i make one mistake and and to them it might have been huge and i'm sorry about that but it's just like i made one mistake and it's like everything was poked through it gets thrown out the window and like an example of me not forgiving someone or me not really wanting to build a relationship anymore with my parents because kind of just the way that all went down it's much bigger than one mistake it's you know fourteen years mistakes it's a long time and my brother thinks i need to speak to it's just all all these relationship issues seem to be coming up and i i'm not the relationship expert obviously i i i kind of fail but i do try i'm only nineteen it's not like i'm spectacular at life right now i don't know so it's just like trying to weight out pros and cons and trying to figure out who uh is going to be most beneficial that is my update for now i will update uh more often hopefully and i hope everyone is doing well,,871
657,hey youtube before i started i just wanted to say thank you for continuing to watch my videos and for subscribing and everything like that i just logged on today and i just saw the amount of subscribers i had in the big picture it's not that much but i mean it's just so cool that you guys are actually interested i know there's so many like funny stupid brainless sort of videos on the internet you click on them and you watch them and that's cool i'm guilty of it too failblog all the way but you know i wanna try and do something different with this channel you know i want to sorta encourage like thinking and shared creativity and inspire and just make people think you know and i know a lot of people aren't really up for that and i know the internet it's a great way to do that but the quantity of those kinds of videos and the popularity of those obviously aren't as big of some of the other more comedic uh stupid videos out there you know so to see that many people interested in my videos is really amazing so thank you so much for that really all right sorry for that bit of a tangent there man man i just sorta wanted to talk i haven't actually done one of these in a long time i've just been so busy it feels kinda strange to talk to my computer again i just want to talk a bit about like dreams and goals you know we all have em we all want to do things in our life and get certain places in our life and accomplish certain things i i mean i have a lot of goals i have a lot of big dreams but sometimes it just gets to a point where you know it scares me almost every single day to think that i might not achieve them you know might not get to where i want to be or you know things just won't work out the way i hope they hope they hope they woo clearly i haven't done this in a long time hope they do so it's good to be determined i am definitely very determined and i have a lot of things on my to do list i am going to do that i'm determined to follow through on these ambitions and you know do what i want to do in my life and be happy and content and that determination you know comforts me but at the same time i'm getting to a point where it's you know if i if i don't quite get to where i want to be how i feel that i won't be fulfilled you know that i won't be satisfied and it's scary it's like someone wanting to dig a hole to japan you know the old myth that you could just dig a hole through the earth to get to the other side china or japan and i'm digging that hole and i'm going down there and i'm getting there but at the same time i look back and i'm so deep that there's no way out of it you know i'm on this route and i have these dreams and i have to get there but at the same time it's scary because i know that if i don't get there i'm going to be stuck in this hole it's i don't know basically i'm rambling gosh i just was wondering you know i'm sure many of you have dreams and ambitions or had some and you've achieved them maybe accomplished them maybe are still working on them what do you do to sort of comfort yourself in hopes of achieving them you know how do you you know tell yourself that you know everything's going to be okay things will work out the way they're supposed to work out because to me just saying that is not enough you know i have these dreams i want to do some big things in my life you know i want to get into film and i want to you know i wanna make movies i want to write movies i want to act in movies i want to do all those things fine that's a hard thing to do there's hundreds of other damn goldbergs out here wanting to do the same thing and why me so basically i'm just asking what do you guys do to sort of help your own selves out you know what do you what do you do to help bring up that confidence or maintain your calmness i guess sometimes i'm sitting at home feeling like i should be doing something working on my dreams you know like doing something that will get me further cause sometimes i just can't you know i'm sitting at home at work in a few hours and there's really nothing else to do except watch some tv but to me it's like wasted time like i should constantly be doing something to help me get to where i want to be in my life and you know in one way i guess it's a good thing you know i have this determination but at the same time it freaks me out every day you know scares me every day to think that i have all these dreams and that potentially they might not turn out the way i want them to i don't know i basically i just what are your thoughts on that and like i said what do you guys and girls do to you know just make it all better and you know bring out that confidence in yourselves to actually achieve these wow i'm really rambling this one is going to have to be edited down a lot yeah so anyways it's really hot up here so i think i'm going to go downstairs and get a really cold drink so yeah anyways talk to you later bye,,1019
658,it's quite yeah it's very very sweet little village and uh this other clip i'm gonna show you is partly why i love this village so much so much it's uh it's very beautiful and this is the evening just before the day before we were leaving um and i was taking uh oh what do you call that call that um um we we were going for a swim me and my friend and we hadn't we hadn't done that all summer we both love it love to go swimming uh bathing um but we hadn't done that because we'd been working so much that summer and we did it last the last evening before i left and uh this is just from that evening and i'm getting all like mmm thinking about it because yeah she's one of my best friends and and uh it's very beautiful it was it's a very beautiful place so i think we need to go a bit faster if this video is not going to be too long because you're not going to be bothered to watch it and i've um i haven't yet but i'm going to spend probably hours editing this so watch it to the end okay anyway the next clip is let's have a look yeah it's when me and my dad and my brother are leaving the village and yeah here it is hi youtube um it's so good to see you all um i hardly know what to say that it's been such a long time some of you are going who is that i haven't seen her in ages and i can totally understand that but hello i'm um welcome to the new subscribers that have joined us um during the time i've been away i don't know what to say just to so we'll just get cracking cause there's a lot of clips for me to show you and i just need you to understand them just give me cut me a bit of slack here this is what i'm working with okay this is my computer okay and i have to do this i have to push it like that just to get a screen so as you can guess i'm getting a new computer but this is why it's so difficult for me to make videos yeah so anyway now that you know that let's get to the first clip the first clip i need to show you is from the summer when we were um just about um to go off to the wedding it was the twenty fourth of july and i promise you you would meet my new roommate emma and you will and here's the clip that we'll show you hello youtube um we're about to go to the wedding i was talking about and we're going by bus because we don't really have any other choice so here we are meet emma youtube go to meet emma emma youtube and this is us looking all nice and dressed for the wedding and this is our lovely transport and it's going to come down this road very soon so that was emma um actually the wedding was absolutely beautiful it was absolutely beautiful it was actually i had such a good time i've it must have been the best wedding i've ever been to i had such an amazingly good time really um um the church that got married in this is really old church and and a lot of people get married there during the summers and just after the wedding i was there too there was another wedding and i think that either the bride or groom must have been scottish because just when we left there were other guests coming and they had this man playing bagpipes outside of the church and i just filmed it a bit because a lot of bagpipes i really do love it but bagpipes that's what you call it um but i'm going to show you but you might want to turn the volume down just a little bit for this clip yeah bagpipes one of these days i'm going to learn to play it i'm going to play it for you and you will all unsubscribe um yeah after the wedding i went home to my village again and i helped my dad and brother pack everything up and clean the house and these were like one of the warmest days that summer it was so warm and this is just a clip that i filmed when i was cleaning out one of the rooms and we'd been cleaning for hours and hours for days actually and we were all just so tired of it so yeah we just hated it and we hated the house we just wanted to leave uh this is a clip of it and yeah i i watched it just now and i'm almost i'm so glad i'm done with that well anyway here it is hello people we're cleaning out the house and it's i'm not kidding but its forty five degrees it's in the weather and it's so flipping warm and i know it's been on the record that i have gone through this entire move and this entire clean out of this house singing it's too hot it's too hot in this town my will to live is melting and that's what's got me down it's too hot and it's still stuck in my head and i can't stop singing it it's terrible and it's so hot so it's very appropriate i suppose but yeah i'm going to keep cleaning now anyway i just wanted to pop in to say hi rrrr i just want to show you my village the village i lived in just bits of pieces of it and the first clip you'll see is just like um from the balcony of my friends house and it's not obviously not the entire village but almost it's not very big so here's that after that we went down south in sweden to our family um our relatives that live down there and we spent a few days with them and some friends of ours and uh that's also a very beautiful place you should go to sweden really it's a beautiful country um here are just some bits and pieces of that trip this next clip is from when we had arrived in spain because i went down to spain with my dad and my brother cause they are moving there as i said and this is just a clip of my dad making dinner he likes to cook he really likes to cook um and it was the first evening in in their new apartment so this is when he my dad cooking you should've been to that taste that because that was really nice it tasted very very good um and this last clip is just uh what i filmed on the plane because the clouds it seriously looked like you could walk on them you know in movies when they walk on on on on like in the sky on clouds yeah it just totally looked like you could i so wanted to step out and just walk on it would probably would not have been a good idea but this is just just what it looked like it was just yeah so that was it um as i promised you and i know we haven't see each other in a long time well actually it did upload that thing in the mac store not like i that was fun i've never done that before and

660,it's saturday and you're watching this week we are talking about what we want to be or what we wanted to be um when we grew up and i don't think it's been that easy a question for everyone because i think everyone goes through that uh you know goes through twenty thirty time things that they want to be um just about everyone i know i've had a lot of things um i had really huge desire to be a singer like kaitlin um i never really thought i had what it took to make it so i didn't pursue it in any way i wanted to be an actress and was really into drama but oh my gosh i as bad a singer as i am i am so much worse an actor um but you know i love those things i do them anyway but um but you know i always thought i'd do something creative if i was gonna teaching was the one thing that i actually thought i might go into i i spent a lot of time just not even knowing growing up i really didn't have any one thing i was like i want to be this um when i got to like high school when you're really supposed to be thinking about these things i i kind of focused on teaching because because i love kids because um because it left me open to um any field really because you can become a teacher of anything so i still you saw that bug this time right okay i'm pretty sure okay um anyway so i could be anything i could teach anything so that was kind of my thing i just never really had anything i really wanted to focus on more recently i thought about going back to school for things but um i just don't know the the only thing i really would go back to school for is psychology i really find the way people thing fascinating and if you watch youtube you probably do too if you watch blogs because that's really what it's all about is just kind of people watching without being creepy you know there is one thing that i can safely say i always wanted to be and when i'm asked the question what did you want to be when you grew up it's usually my answer because it's it's absolute it's the one thing that i never wavered on and that is i wanted to be a mommy and i live that dream and i am so i feel so fortunate to to be able to say i do what i wanted to do when i grew up i um i'm really really blessed that i get to stay home a and be with my boy because i was a nanny before i had kids it was it was actually the perfect job obviously um and the fact is i stay i ha i spent so much more time with these kids than their parents did and it really made me sad to think that um that their parents were missing out on these things i mean um i took care of them from the time they were babies like couple months old i saw first steps i saw a first word and i really i swore i just did not want to be that parent that missed those things and uh not that i'm saying anything bad about those parents because they had to do what they had to do um you know they they were just doing what they needed to to to provide so i guess that's about it next week i'm so excited i cannot wait for my secret santa present thing is like kaitlin i wanna wait i thought i was gonna have i was gonna be the only one who was like open it i'm a three year old when it comes to christmas presents i just i want to open them i want to shake them and then rip em open so um i hope i don't have to wait to do that i will video it of course that's the point but i'm not waiting till next saturday it's just not gonna happen it will be after christmas how can i wait till after christmas to open it that's not gonna happen but um you know but what i am so much more excited actually i'm really excited to get my present and just see what um what someone would get for me because i because i'm kind of new and not as well known you know we don't know each other as well so it will be interesting to see but i'm actually really more excited to see everyone else open their presents um i'm a give i'm a giver i'm a taker too come on i like to get but i just love to give gifts i love it i wish i was filthy rich because i would just buy everyone presents every day of the year anyway tomorrow's and then we start secret santa week it'll be so much fun make sure to come watch us open our presents isn't that the fun of christmas anyway merry christmas everybody,,887

yourself tagged so anyway um you wanted five facts about me all right okay let me think let me think let me think let me think you know anything about me emmett what should i start with okay um fact number one wow okay now don't go and tell me to please say something in german because like i can actually think of something on the spot you know don't put me on the spot okay i came to america sometimes in september oh my god i forgot to pay september ninety four yeah that's when i came to united states and i've been ever since and i have not spoken any german ever since then so um you know it's true what they say you don't use it you lose it so i lost it it takes me about ten minutes to put a sentence together because i really forgot how to speak deutsch but i can still understand you i can still read it but you know no don't ask please okay thinking thinking thinking fact number two what's fact number two you don't know i have two of these this right here's emmett and romeo well who knows where he is but uh i'll grab him later yeah i got two boy cats and i love them to bits and pieces even if they bite me yes bye bye yep fact number three yeah fact number three i am a empath now what this means is um okay there's uh uh there's different kind of empaths in the world but um what this means is i am very sensitive to people around me that includes cats too it means whoever i'm around i not only feel what this person is feeling i also kind of sort of become that person whether i like it or not i haven't really found a way to control that quite yet but i'm working on it but um yeah i'm around a whole lot of people i can become drained very quickly because i tend to feel everybody all at the same time and woo it's kind of like taking a ride in a blender you know so that's one reason why i can never ride a bus because oh my god yikes i'm usually sick for about two weeks after i get off a bus so i can't do buses because of that i'm trying to avoid crowds too because it's just not it's just not very healthy for me okay that was fact number three now okay number four hey i like this bonding thing we're doing here let's see fact number four um oh fact number four i'm not smoking anymore have you noticed in none of my videos you see a cigarette popping up no more hmm hmm yeah that was one of the hardest things i've ever done but also the one of the best things now the way i got off of cigarettes was with a nicotine patch it's called what's it called nicquitin cq now that stuff works like a charm you start with step one just slap on the patch and uh no more cravings completely gone now the best now the best part about nicquitin cq for me anyways was at nighttime when i went to sleep oh my god i had dreams in three d and technicolor i couldn't wait to go back to sleep it was like going to a movie uh you wake up and you and you remember almost everything it was amazing yeah love when that happens i'm so glad i did it that's the best thing i've ever done and i i swear i will never pick up another cigarette ever again i've gotten stressed again after afterwards yeah but still stayed smoke free and i'm a keep it that way now that's probably the reason why i gained a little weight because when you stop smoking um you're gonna put on a few pounds comes with the territory but i feel a lot healthier oh yeah now um okay um um um um um what else what else what else what else what else what else fact number five fact number five here comes romeo come here ay ay ay ay ah ah what a moomb romeo hey gorgeous now this is my slinky little romeo ain't he a angel

664,hello youtubers um in my last video i actually had used the music from a local band i figured i'd just um give you a little bit more detail on it it's a band called sproll it's actually a band from my home town um i actually know one of the members in the band who i did work with til recently um the music is awesome as you already heard um the song in particular which was um eyes have spoken is on disc which their first ep called soft science um now they have another follow up album called radio that just came out um you can get information at www dot sproll dot ca or at maplemusic dot com you can actually order the cds from there um just we're gonna give you a little explanation on that music and uh but you should go and check them out they're really awesome i haven't actually had the chance to see them live yet i keep missing their shows so i'm hoping that i will get to see the next show so i promise glen i will make it to your next show um there it is that's it i just figured i would share that with you,,210
665,today i would like to bring you a motivational speech from the regions of waco america a short time ago in a county not too far away i addressed you the youtube community by way of an over eloquent vernacular i again wish to do so and would ask that you continue to view this video to hear the rest of the speech war on terror an almost trite declaration by the us government in this day and age begs the question as to how they will fight such a war on terror with little suzie terrified of tarantulas and thirty year old marvin still concerned about what life is like outside of his mother's household it is a wonder how the service men and women of our country can take on such a giant as terror i however would like to offer a solution and to those of you chemistry folk by solution i do not mean a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances but rather an answer to an enduring question within the confines of american society we must begin by creating an altruistic society in which the people do not think for themselves by controlling the thoughts and minds of americans through outlets such as cnn and fox news and and or the national enquirer we will discover that terror only exists in our minds once people are no longer thinking for themselves we should initiate a false war on terror on horror on love and other emotions that could at one point or another inflict pain on a humanoid accomplishing these things would do wonders for the society that we live in today and by wonders i do not mean things that happened in the old testament or the bible but rather a strange unity amongst the people considering the fact that they're being controlled by the same outlet with that i conclude my antagonizing and otherworldly speech take what you like leave what you hate for this is the american idea of hope change and something else that i can't remember,,347
666,you're probably starting this video thinking who is this guy what's he doing on this channel he doesn't belong here especially because his voice isn't sped up this is a place of sped up voices you that's what we're here for that's what we're here to see guess what i'm not i know shocking resemblance but not not also my hair is not the right color or look at all really everything about me doesn't look like him but whatever i am here to tell you that i have information for you information about he did an interview with me me baby you know because i know a lot of you are always asking questions in the comments you know hey where do you live hey what's your phone number hey i wanna stalk you hey i wanna stalk you you know and uh the video it actually answers a lot of those questions you know like a his name's it's in there b his name's i think he says there's something about ninjas in there he likes ninjas but he also likes pirates he wants to combine them or something i don't know whatever there's actually sixty minutes of interview minutes that i had to cut down into about twenty minutes uh two parts segment of this interview and uh so it's very chopped up question answer question answer but it should be pretty entertaining and for you guys who are looking at the first half going eh this is kind of boring check out the second half of the video its actually i find most of the jokes are probably in the second half check it out links in the side bar great interview brought to you by anti work he gives all kind of information you know his social insurance number his email address his phone number you know the exact address of where he lives uh his facebook account his ms no his uh his myspace his pager number uh his cell phone number his house number his xbox live gamer tag everything you want to know about him is in this interview but not really,,360

670,part three okay um the argument against homosexuality is that aside from a biblical sense is that a lot of homosexual allowing homosexual people to have children would be detrimental for the children and let's back track a little bit and review why apparently it would be detrimental to the children no let's backtrack a little bit and discuss the idea of homosexual marriage the idea of ho actually let's backtrack a lot and discuss another reason why you wouldn't want to give homosexuals marriage namely that marriage should only be give to groups of people that are procreate so the argument of religious people and they don't have their precious bible to back them up is that marriage is a function that is and always shall be solely for procreation and since gay people you know it it doesn't work you know and lesbians you know not much getting done there in way of procreation not much getting done in the way of procreation in a um homosexual relationship that's honest that's true and i've heard this argument a million times before so i'm just going to say it again old people can't marry then infertile people can't marry then you know um what about uh women who have gone through menopause can they get married anymore and then if the couple should get married and decide not to have children you know are they like committing some grand atrocity they decide not to populate the chil they decide not to populate the earth or what happens if a couple has kids and then neither of them can have anymore kids all of the sudden should the marriage just be erased the true definition of marriage is not an idea of procreation certainly that's certainly it's part of it but the original definition of marriage was an ide was a social contract for a male to gain property mainly the female the female was considered property now that really throws it in that really sort of throws a wrench in the whole operation when women all of a sudden aren't considered property anymore you know because all of the sudden you know it's not an idea of property this idea that marriage is is for love purposes it really is a twentieth century idea you know of course we've carried it into this century but it has not been around for more than a hundred years or so um marriage was a contract it is a contract still it's a social contract you're stating to your governing body that you two are going to sort of coexist co uh you're going to exist as one let's just say it that way so in exchange for entering into this social contract the government gives you certain benefits and that is a lot of what this argument is about for fighting for gay marriage benefits is that it's not even the title of gay marriage that we're getting after it's the idea that if you do not allow gay people to marry you're denying them these benefits these rights that are granted to heterosexual married couples heterosexual married couples have almost number an almost infinite number of rights like the just so you know the most the most obvious example um like if one if one partner is in the hospital the other partner can go in there they're treated as family now if a gay couple if one of the one of the partners was to be in the hospital the doctor can tell that person not to go in they can keep them out because they don't have to because they're not married and i'll get into the the idea of civil union versus marriage i have my own opinion about that but um yeah so the idea that homosexuality in marriage will destroy the american family i just have to say i feel sorry for people who are so insecure about their own marriages that they have to blame homosexuals for destroying their marriages the only marriages homosexuals have ever destroyed are sham marriages that homosexuals entered into to protect their own identity and the only reason they destroyed them is because they were honest with themselves so you know really homosexual marriage,,715
671,are you okay are you okay are you okay are you okay oh hey guys um this is our got suspended and possibly forever basically forever yeah um okay um it was maybe a year ago um maybe less maybe not half a-year ago but maybe a little bit more that a half a-year ago i have first got my actually when did come out was that it was in may of two thousand and eight i think maybe i'm not sure um but that's why i put this video up the video was will farrell's the landlord everyone knows that video everyone knows um who's battling the internet about the landlord video so i put it not knowing about youtube's this is when they first started ah do the youtube you're going to get zapped into suspension or deletion if you put a video up copyrighted by a celebrity or anything so i didn't know about it uh they first started to do it so it was this i posted a video maybe at two o'clock or three o'clock in the morning um because am i frozen right now yeah i think i was frozen i'm not sure sorry my computer may have just said that um but it was at two or three o'clock in the morning because i remember my sister went to the dark night opening at midnight and i stayed up all night on the computer so i put the landlord up maybe five minutes ten minutes later youtube sent me a thing they've took it down saying well they've made it unavailable for people to watch they said if you don't take this down we will suspend and delete your account so i'm like okay so i delete it half a-year a year later comes which was a couple of weeks ago and i try to log into my account and it says this account you can not access this account change email or something like that so i message youtube and i say on a on email and they are no help at all and google i can't call them because they don't have people to talk to it's really confusing well maybe they do it's just really confusing for me so i send it in and they say they also suspended another account that i made for shinsei it's an anime um they also suspended that too so it is like a double whammy i was pretty popular on there too i had a lot of subscribers but still many views on my videos but it's not my videos but anyways let's get to the point and on the email it said the things that made me get suspended it had the landlord on it and what i was thinking was um my mom was screaming i'll give you a freaking buck i don't know if you guys heard it but yeah dismind her she's i don't know okay but um okay um where was i oh yeah so they say we suspended you because of the landlord and it said you have to settle the dispute with um with um with will ferrel or who made it maybe from udie dot com i don't know but i am pretty sure that it was will ferrel it was the creator of the video i think they said so yeah so that's pretty impossible um so that's that and even they said even if i settle the dispute with him that i probably wouldn't get my subscribers my friends and my videos back so if you know um and so that's that with it and so i made topic revised i'm going to make all i'm going to redo all the episodes of um of ah a d-i t-o a-l s is that the for it i think i think i said it right in the abbreviations and um udderface i'm bringing udderface back and um and so and so yeah that is what's going on i um there's no more highly logical of what you have read on my channel and so yeah basically yeah i am never going to get my channel back so this is the new home so everyone um i have a twitter account i i just really want people to start following me so um and so yeah that's about it so bye you guys um subscribe please so yeah uh bye,,745
672,hey everybody it's october thirtieth two thousand and nine i am and i am not a vegetarian but i probably should be as you can probably tell from the title i'm presumably going to give this video there's probably a title right above my head as you watch this on the internet for a variety of reasons vegetarianism makes sense the first thing typically the first thing i've read anyway that vegetarians or vegans which is vegetarian plus you know they don't even drink milk which would be hard for me man i always drink milk milk is cool healthy and everything so the first thing that i typically hear vegetarians bring up is the moral issue that animals have certain rights and we shouldn't kill them and eat them and i've always sort of wondered about that i certainly believe we have to protect the environment you know the environment produces all of our air for instance and if we pollute the air we will not have any more air to breathe and the humans will all die so you know let's not do that and a variety of other things the environment is complicated i don't like you know you start they're cutting the rainforest and stuff and cause all these other things that eventually just cause crap for people you know so certainly you should respect the natural world in that broad extent now how much respect do you give individual animals though particularly if you you know got get yourself a whole bunch of cows or whatever that you can produce sustainably there would be more cows every new year whatever and you know more cows are born and stuff and they're replacing the old ones and there's no particular pollution going on though there are separate things with the way we mess with our livestock and jack them up with a whole bunch of hormones and overly high doses of antibiotics even when they're not sick and so forth which is great for profit margins but not necessarily great for us people that eat all of that and other things that can cause in the long run there's stuff that's i like organic food myself i'm not going to eat a whole lot of it but when i can get it i like organic because it means actual organic and not just they called it organic cause it it's complicated animals individually when there's no you know grand environmental impact how much rights do they have it's a thorny issue you know um we don't typically eat dogs you ever notice that dogs are like you know intelligent and we let dogs as pets and stuff wonder if there's some sort of movement where people get cows as pets maybe we'd stop eating cows you know or pigs or whatever other things you like to pet it would be kinda weird to eat it ish you can get into all sorts of issues as it comes down to philosophy the morality of what constitutes you know a thing a human type thing that needs to be protected like is a dog like you know one tenth of a human sort of a thing you know they deserve a certain amount of protection is a cow like one twentieth of a human in terms of how much moral weight it has i don't know really it's complicated ah there's the moral issue here hard to say but discarding that entirely i still ought to be a vegetarian why well its healthy i looked it up it's actually healthier you get all your nutrients from vegetables what i'm sorry sorry from non meat products grains fruits vegetables uh et cetera et cetera you think well you can get like you get protein from meat right yeah you're better off getting your protein from other stuff i think like peanuts have protein or nuts of some kind oh gee i don't even know on the top of my head but i remember looking this up and as it happens we're uniquely evolved to need meat like if all the teeth of a mouth for instance even the pointy one is actually you know part of a normal plant eating mouth and such there's no vital thing that you get only from meat and you know everyone knows we ought to eat more vegetables just to be healthy in general well if you're a vegetarian you'd probably eat up a lot more vegetables one would think and then getting back to the environment thing meat takes up a lot more resources the math is on this but like you could have x amount of corn or whatever to feed a cow which would feed so many people but like if you didn't have the cow eat the corn and you cut out the middle then you end up feeding like a whole lot more people with the original amount of corn if everyone was eating corn or whatever but we're not we're eating cows which is much less efficient takes up much more land much more resources and i don't know if you've been attention just last couple of decades or something but somewhat iffy on the resources bit the population going up granted not up as fast as was predicted uh global warming getting worse so thankfully there's more um awareness of it so hopefully we'll turn something around here at some point i mean just the general principle that i like to divide not using more resources than i need which i'm not going to pretend to be a saint in that regard but i like the principle of it anyway you eat the thing which is you know could feed more people eat them in the more efficient sort of way and that way happens to be healthier put those two together that is enough for yeah i should be a vegetarian so i've been thinking about that one the last few weeks and i've been eating less meat at meals i can get more salad and stuff haven't really switched over yet but i ought to and the rest of the world ought to and we'd save ourselves a lot of resources and a lot of headaches of a very you know medical crap that happens because we don't get enough of random nutrients that we ought to get i don't think those multivitamin pills are really going to help you with that for some reason they're not exactly sure why but for some reason it's so much better to get nutrients out of actual food than a pill like the pill may help but not half as much as the food it's healthier being a vegetarian it's more efficient and thus you know better for the environment you use less resources and there might even be a moral question to boot in there so yeah i ought to be a vegetarian i ought to getting around to that and i'm pretty sure the rest of the world ought to be to or at least you know you don't have to go one hundred percent vegetarian but like eat less meat maybe could you could we all try that we'd all of us just eat like ten percent less meat than you would otherwise you know just see if that works take this a step at a time i don't know thanks for watching see you,,1251
673,i haven't this much writing this week because i just haven't been motivated and i noticed that a lot of my friends that were doing it haven't really been either so this poem is for them christine kara paige and kaitlin and for myself the words won't come minutes and hours and days of staring at the blank sheet and yet nothing comes to mind what should they say what should they do you have no idea how could you you don't know yourself what to do or what to say when you feel lost when you feel empty what's left to give when you've already taken everything you have and already put it in there's nothing left to do or say you have nothing and in reading that i just realized that it's kind of about the chartjackers single which is out today it makes me happy i m going to go buy that soon and i think everybody should too link in the sidebar and hopefully next week will go better i'm going to go finish reading mother night i realize that i'm way behind in my fifty book challenge um that's like my thirty eighth book i have like eight weeks to read twelve books so procrastination strikes again see,,213

675,for those of you watching for the first time welcome i'm your host i have been making these for three years now that's the same amount of time that i have been living in japan and probably the same amount of time i would say that i have been studying that japanese language a little bit before i came to japan i studied too but i just round it out to three years if you're watching this and it's your very first video that you have ever watched on my channel awesome great for those of you who have followed my channel for a long time i'm sorry but this is probably going to be a boring video and say a lot of things that you've already heard many times before okay but what this video is here for is to condense answers for many many of the same questions i get over and over again that i have answered before or number two are private things that i'm just never going to answer one main thing that i ask is before you send any question please scroll through my videos i have them listed in order and with every video i've listed the topic that i covered on the faq if you see the topic go ahead and check it out and see if i cover what you are about to ask if i do not cover the aspect that you wanted please tell me the video number that you've referenced and what aspect you want and i'll be happy to send you an e mail explaining more if need be otherwise please watch this video first and then check out all the topics in my other ones before you think about sending a question otherwise you're you are going to get referenced to this video again or i'll just never answer your question thanks for watching let's start with that number one question i get number one and that is scott what jobs can i get in japan a lot of people ask me this again again and again what jobs can i get in japan well that's definitely a sign that you haven't watched any of my videos because in twenty to about thirty of my videos over the length of about a hundred videos i've said again and again that teaching english is the only job that you can get unless you speak fluent or native level japanese unless you speak fluent japanese or have a spouse visa that means you are married to a japanese person and are staying in japan under a spouse visa there's some people that are in the military that's a totally different story okay they have come over with the military i'm not including that okay and then there are some people who are civilians in japan who work for the military and that's a totally different story too okay you're still coming over with the military in my opinion for those of you who have no connection to the military and are just trying to get over here and get a job unless you speak fluent and i mean native level japanese you are not going to get any other job than teaching english please do not send me an e mail asking how can i be a construction worker in japan how can i be a scientist in japan can i be a doctor in japan no number one you need a four year degree or the equivalent to a bachelor's degree in anything it can be anything to teach english here in japan this will allow you to get past emigration and get approved for a work visa and then you send all your information in to emigration and then they approve you for the work visa in my first video i stated that you couldn't switch from a tourist visa but tokyo sam uh updated me on that and said that yes it is possible i did it so you can come over here on a tourist visa search for a job and get approved it is possible the other rule is a spouse visa you can come over here on a spouse visa which you can stay on permanently okay you don't need to switch to a work visa but you can also land a job that way as well uh some people i have even seen forego having a four year degree and get a job with a spouse visa so that's the other exception sometimes people even get other jobs but they're on a spouse visa they're not on a work visa other than that there is no other job that you can get okay some people have asked me scott can i teach my native language which is spanish french et cetera et cetera yes okay there are jobs like that here in japan where people do teach languages outside of the english realm okay obviously japan is an educated place they want to learn more that just one other language um so yes you can get a job doing that they're not as common as teaching english but they do exist and you can get approved for a work visa on those languages but unless you speak native or fluent level japanese there is no other job you can get other than teaching language nothing nothing you can get a little extra work in the food service area or a bar okay some are oriented towards gagin of have a gagin theme so they hire gagin okay but those people do not get work visas and japan will not approve a work visa for working at one of those places now there is exceptions to the rule okay but they are very few and far between i could probably count them one hand for instance in tokyo there are hotels that have an entire industry built around gagin who come over here for business trips and their entire staff is gagin and they are on uh special visas but those people have worked really hard to get those jobs and they are an exception to the rule okay don't ask me about how to get those i've never worked in that business here in japan i have no idea i'm cannot connect you with that now some people do come over here as just english teachers and work their way up to different jobs they start to learn the language they start to get networking they start to get connections outside of that realm and they move into other things great if you have any doubt google it that's always the best information that i can give you what companies hire overseas i don't know anymore it used to me nova i've heard of oth kiawas which is an english conversation school that hire overseas but a lot has changed since the economy has bombed and it's not as common to get hired overseas if it does happen you will know in your country i don't know here in japan okay no company comes to me and says hey scott let your viewers know that we are now hiring overseas if they do it you will have to google it you will have to research it you will have to find out that information yourself as for the jet programme i have never worked in the jet programme um from what i hear it is the cream of the crop they treat you really well you have to contact your japanese embassy to learn about it if you want to know more about the jet programme i suggest contacting somebody who's actually worked in it like myargonauts another j blogger and possibly he can give you a lot of information on him but uh you know he might be bombed with a lot of e mails too so don't always expect a response and even though i do work as an english teacher here in japan i don't have any connections for you okay please do not write to me asking if i can get you a job in japan please do not ask me if i have any networking abilities that can land you a job if i can get you an interview or if i can hook you up with the board of education in my area no no and no okay finally the most basic breakdown for getting an english teaching job in japan step one look for a company some hire overseas but it's rare most hire directly within japan so your first step is probably going to be coming to japan or finding that company that hires overseas step two go for an interview all right send your resume they'll send you an e mail or contact you letting you know they want an interview with you go ahead and prepare for that all the same rules apply just like any interview dress very professionally use professional language some are going to require you to teach a sample lesson in that case be ready to teach for the age group that you would possibly teaching for the job some are for kids some are for adults it all depends it will vary with the job that you have applied for part three if you are accepted if you are accepted the company will most likely sponsor you a work visa you must work a certain amount of hours to get a work visa as of right now i am unsure as the total hours that you need in which to get a work visa i believe it's twenty eight or more hours but i could be wrong so don't hold me to,,1636

677,the project for awesome has begun so to this is the best time of year because this is when we dominate youtube with charity and goodness and awesomeness and it's one of the days that we never forget to be awesome and you know what it's gonna be great and so when you're done with this video comment it and rate it and then go to a bunch of other videos and comment those and rate those and start conversations in the comments to get them on the front page of youtube so that people start realizing how important charity is and it's gonna be awesome so that's why we call it the project for awesome imagine a world where you have no choice for you but your coffee it was at starbucks that was the only place i mean it was one corporation it had dominated everything else and all local businesses were gone and the only place where you could buy your coffee was at starbucks not much choice there you can't decide for yourself what coffee you like better you can't you know buy cheaper coffee in it's it's our economy depends on local businesses and that's why i am going to support what is not necessarily a charity but it is a non profit organization to support local businesses and help them thrive and it's called the american independence business alliance so how it works is local business decide to form alliances within their towns and overall all these alliances are springing up across america and so when you go on the website for the whole thing you can link to other cities websites and sometimes you can even find your own city and you might not have known this organization even existed but it does and you can go to the website which is gonna be linked in the doobly doo and then when you get to the cities page they have a list of all the businesses in that city that are part of the alliance and that's a good place to start if you don't know where to shop locally not all cities have this but a lot of them do and if you find your city on that list then great and go there and shop there for christmas this is a great time of year to decide where you're going to shop and the reasons why you should do this are also gonna be linked in the doobly doo it's an article and i'm just gonna tell you a little bit about this research project that was done in austin texas comparing franchises and local businesses found out that on average at a franchise thirteen dollars out of a hundred goes back to the community in wages or uh in taxes things like that thirteen dollars at a local business for every hundred dollars spent forty five dollars goes back in taxes and wages and things into the community i mean imagine how much more that's helping local businesses have to pay city taxes and that goes to making your roads better it improves the community a lot and then you also have the fact that the businesses start to grow if everyone engages in this kind of business it starts to make local areas get stronger and then when local areas get stronger the whole economy of america starts to get stronger there's a lot of information on the website and you can find out why it's important to buy locally so go to your local businesses and do your christmas shopping there,,603
678,yiga kiga for sure nostalgia critic because i think he's funnier than the avgn even though avgn has more nostalgic videos and my favorite animal of all time has to be dogs i mean i love dogs hello dearest friends and subscribers it's ag and i'm here to answer your questions from last week and boy do we have a lot of them what would you say is the best zelda title wouldn't it be at the top if they made a zelda movie what's your favorite band song genre well if they made a zelda movie i would be totally psyched for that and to be honest it's actually a big dream of mine to direct a zelda movie that would be the pinnacle of anything i ever direct in my whole life would be a legend of zelda movie not sure if i can do it but in a fan film i can definitely do it but um like a hollywood feature film i would totally go see it totally i don't really have a favorite band but my favorite genre of music has been like r and b rap and hip hop why because i kinda grew up with so it's just ingrained in me and yup the music nowadays is not as good as it was when i was growing up but saying that makes me feel old but i do believe that and my favorite song probably has to be iris by the goo goo dolls what are your thoughts about nintendo to bring back the koopalings in news from meyer brothers wii well it seems that nintendo only thinks the koopalings belong in two d but i would love to see them in a three d game that's all i have to say you know i didn't really schedule when is coming out how about you give me a reasonable date and i'll try to do it by then to be honest i'm not really interested in the zelda hand held games they are kind of continuing where wind waker left off and ah it's not a big deal who's the one person you would really like to meet it could be anybody the one person that i would really like to meet is robert rodriguez because he's the one that really inspired me to be a film maker and showed me that you can make a movie with a shoestring budget as long as you are really creative and have a good story if you could remake any movie which would you do and why i really wouldn't remake anything um remaking movies in hollywood especially this decade has been a business of its own because of our economic times that we have been going through lately and ah it's usually it's just a big marketing strategy because ah hollywood knows that if they remake something from the past and you're familiar with that franchise you're more likely to go see that than something that's original because you might see something that's original and like oh i don't know about that movie i don't know if i should see that but if a new miami vice comes out a new friday the thirteenth a new nightmare on elm street oh wow they remade this movie i know that movie i know those characters and then you go pay to see it it happens all the time and that's what's making money for hollywood and they're going to keep doing it until they run out of remakes to do and then they are just going to be remaking the remakes which makes a lot of sense why don't you do any more movie giveaways as a movie messenger well in the beginning i was giving a way dvds but then when i did as good as it gets and marley and me i had contests for those videos and nobody participated and i had bought four copies of as good as it gets and i bought a really good copy of marley and me and i spent like fifty bucks on those and nobody participated in the contest i was like wow that was like a waste of money so then i just threw away the contest thing and i was like eh forget about it and ah that's that but i do plan to bring back the dvd giveaways in the future so don't worry about that um it's going come come again soon okay do you like heist movie and if so what is you favorite and if nintendo suddenly went bankrupt what would you think you would do and if nintendo went bankrupt i'm pretty sure either sony or microsoft would buy them if the internet died what do you think would happen chaos would ensue do you know the movie preview critic here on youtube no well basically this question's asking me would i rather play ocarina of time for the rest of my life or watch the shawshank redemption for the rest of my life i would have to say play ocarina of time for the rest of my life and here's why because i think if i watch shawshank redemption like a million times i would probably get sick of it but i think if i was like deserted on some like desert island and i had to play ocarina of time em it wouldn't be as bad because i mean even though i'd be alone and you know think about like that movie cast away like if i was like him and i was on that island with ocarina of time i would probably just talk to the characters on the screen like they were real kinda like he did with the volleyball i'd be like hey madeline hey talin how's it going you know just walking through the stages and talking to all those townsfolk like they were real people i mean i'd be crazy but i'd at least i'd have friends sort of i actually love the smash bros series to death um bear characters to use the regular smash bros pikachu smash bros melee pikachu and smash bros brawl kirby because they give to pikachu best version melee cause it's a lot harder and takes a lot more skill to play what are you thoughts about the remake of the s animated movie akira and have you seen battle royale yet uh the remakes again uh they should be fine i don't know i mean they're remaking everything so who knows as long as they don't make it like that dragon ball z movie that just came out it should be okay and battle royale no i haven't seen it but i will let you know when i do what was the most violent movie that played as you were growing up believe or not it was mortal kombat and that's why i loved it so much and that's why parents were whooping out about it and that's why senators went crazy over the violence and if you play it today it's pretty damn tame would you consider doing a link to the past walkthrough and what is your opinion on remakes in general a link to the past walkthrough that would take forever to do um do you ever need a link to the past walkthrough mmm i don't know if you really want one i'll think about it i want to make my walkthroughs kinda different from other people's walkthroughs i want em to do interactive so if there's a way i can figure out inter active sure i'll do link to the past and i think you already heard what i said about remakes so i don't believe you should do one no i mean hollywood's only doing it to make money but that that understandable what's your favorite rpg i think i answered this one already but if i didn't it's final fantasy nine what games out there that are loved by everyone you don't like in my last question i asked what you up for a series well i have another what kind of structure they use to make it look good lighting camera angles that kinda thing a game that everybody likes that i don't like freaking halo on xbox and more tips to help you make your web series it's gonna take forever like a whole other video to do so i'm gonna put links to the description to help you out their youtube tips to help with your lighting and your videography and that kind of thing so that should help you out and other links to other sites and that can help you out too do i like polk fiction man this movie is amazing and this dvd just a collector's edition has so much bonus material i just couldn't stand it it just this is what dvds are all about so if you haven't if you don't have this dvd it's a collector's edition of polk fiction i recommend it highly recommend it um i love quentin tarantino's movies i just bought in glorious bastards on dvd bought this one at target cause it came with a soundtrack best buy was selling this for twenty four ninety five just by itself but if you buy this at target right now it comes with the the movie soundtrack too so that's pretty freaking awesome favorite tv show of all time is the wonder years what are your thoughts on the catsylvania series and the direction it took after symphony of the night well on the nes i had all the catsylvania games as a kid i loved number three the best because you can play as different characters so i always played as aloe card um cause you can fly around with a bat and pretty much fly over like the whole stage i mean if you have enough magic and i played the super super catsylvania four which i thought was pretty amazing then when i got to symphony of the night it was a really great step up for the series but since then it's like all the games are trying to be like symphony of night but not as good so um i'm not really excited about the newer ones all the time because they're always mimic symphony of the night like the and the ds i've kinda played a couple of those i was like ahh it's just like been there played that,,1762
679,hi guys uh this is uh also known as a now to my more popular fan base or the fan base to which i am more popular or something i i don't even know you know i i'm through with trying to come up with witty introductions because i ain't got em today i'm too tired for that shit thankfully i do have like six days off so maybe i can try to do some catching up on things but a lot of people told me i need to make a blog on here again so here i am here i am making a blog whoopty doo and people have also asked me this um i i guess people can sense that i've been a little out of sorts lately that i've been a little unfocused kind of not all there and it's true i've had quite a bit on my mind lately so maybe this is the place where i can come and kinda talk about it i guess i don't know i figure i didn't make this channel for nothing might as well use it for something the thing is i don't want to come on here and sit here and piss and moan you know because that's just not my style these days to do that i'd rather do that you know to my video camera for my future self than to sit here and burden other people with having to listen to it but i suppose if you really want to hear it just i'll try to keep it tame well i guess one of the big things is that they've cut hours at work again they've basically been cutting them for like the better part of the year now i mean at first it was you know started out and then it was down to like thirty eight i remember complaining when it was thirty eight i'm like dude thirty eight what's the big difference but it was thirty eight i guess that made a big difference to me well try fourteen okay then come back to me and complain about your thirty eight hours seriously fourteen that's how many hours i had last week ooh there's a fart that's all i can say about that you know it's you know and i don't like complaining about this kind of stuff on line because people see it and all you know and this it's not like this is something that anyone actually in the store can do anything about so i guess i feel a little more comfortable knowing that i can you know leave them with that knowledge that i don't blame them for it or anything like that it's just that you know with the bad economy right now and pretty basically everyone's in the shitter because of it it's not just me there's as lot of people suffering we actually had one person who quit two days ago i i didn't think she was going to i couldn't believe she did she was like one of the last persons i thought was going to quit in there or she was one of the last people did i say persons oh my god i really am yeah i didn't expect her to be the next one to quit i did not see that coming at all but she she'd been there like longer than i have and but but i can't say i blame her and apparently a lot of people said the same thing they don't blame her either uh she was a full time worker basically being scheduled for fifteen hours a week now i i was dropped to part time in july so it's understandable in my case to some extent but jeez full time fifteen hours a week next thing you know the bills are coming in and you can't pay em and it's like uh oh uh oh spaghetti o whatcha gonna do so i'm thinking i might have to start looking for a second job pretty soon because i'm in a pretty bad spot right now i was supposed to put new tires on the car this month and i'm not going to be able to do that now so and that's bad because i bought the car in two thousand and four and i haven't changed the tires on it since i bought it so these tires are five years old now i'm driving in snow that's real great and then i have this other thing where i'm trying to make a machinima which is basically for those who don't know it's basically like you take a video game you take video game footage and add dialogue to it that doesn't belong there holy crap what was that uh anyway you take video game footage and you add dialogue that doesn't belong there to make it funny and that's basically machinima video game footage it's a movie made out of video game footage usually comedy sometimes something else anyway so i'm trying to make one out of super smash brothers brawl but i have two big problems number one is that i well actually i have three problems number one is that i don't actually own my own copy of brawl so i've been renting one from the family video store number two is that the two characters i need to make my machinima with i haven't unlocked them yet because it takes like freaking twenty hours of game play to do that and it's just too depressing for me to sit there all that time but if it takes twenty hours just to get to the point where i can start on making the video then the number three problem is i'm trying to get rid of the damage gage at the bottom of the screen what's just kind of a minor detail that i i don't know if everybody does it but apparently you have to hack your wii to do it i don't know if i really want to do that since i run the risk of just disabling it altogether so i might just have to like come up with a different idea it's just that i had this really good idea that i been thinking about for the last week and i wanted to do it and i been i even told the machinima people about it and they said they liked it so so i'm just trying to make the video and i can't freaking do it like i have all the voice acting ready to go the script is ready to go i just don't have the video game footage so i don't know what to do otherwise i guess there's not a whole lot it's a nice halloween actually i'm probably going to sleep through it ahh i i could look around and see if there's a party to go to or something i don't know i just one year ago tonight actually was our halloween party dad hosted for karaoke it was one year ago tonight that we found out my dad had cancer and uh so that's kinda you know that's depressing too but at the same time i almost can't help but feel proud of him for having survived it for a year i mean how many people can say that they survived cancer for a year most people find out they have it you never know how long they got so i know my dad's always been a fighter i mean he was in the army so i know that he's better than this and he's gonna kick it it's all just a matter of time really but in the meantime i just wish i could do more to help him i mean shit i don't know holy shit wait what oh that's me i'm in here oh my god i'm in the phonebook jeez i didn't know that yeah okay there's actually eight bishops in this city i had no idea there was that many bishops oh man okay well now that starts to make me i thought bishop was like a rare last name or something i'm sitting here wondering cause i have like a poster at work of my dad mickey bishop you know who's up you know with the cancer benefit thing and like like i still think that even with that poster hanging in there for a month nobody even knows that my dad's got cancer cause i've never told anybody besides the hr lady you know and i use that as like an excuse because i had i was tardy for work that day and she wanted to know why and i said because that was the day i found out my dad had cancer and i just wasn't all here and she was totally understanding about it but as far as he had i sure as hell got no right to complain about my life i'll tell you that i should be able to get my shit together here go to wal mart put in an application do something just you know do something now while i still can cause i you know i'm still alive and i'm still kicking and i'm doing pretty successful on nintendo capri sun in fact you know you know this might sound bad but i actually think that the stuff i'm doing on nintendo capri sun is probably the most successful thing i've ever done in my life and i know most people say well you're thirty three years old and you play video games you're a loser yeah just go do your butt flexes you know yeah would you rather me go exercise would that be more interesting you know the most hilarious thing about it is that the only people you ever see out running are the ones that don't need to you know the ones who are already in shape the ones that have a good enough metabolism that they don't have to waste their time on it yet they do anyway you know the ones that just run in your face and say hey you know look at me look what i can do it's like yeah well it's easy for you because it's not physically painful you know like it is for someone like me with two hundred and thirty pounds can you imagine what that feels like two hundred and thirty pounds of weight slamming down on the sole of your feet you know once every ten seconds huh if you were laying down when somebody was doing that i guaran fucking tee you it would hurt like hell i guarantee you and yet when you're running no it shouldn't hurt at all it should feel good yeah right yeah right you can't even explain how you can't even explain how uh huh uh huh yes i'm being sarcastic even though honestly i really don't know what the explanation is i don't know what the jive answer is to that one okay so i will see you guys next time uh let's play oops i did it again see ya,,1875

687,hey everyone how's it going i hope this video finds you well last week i recorded a video and as i was editing through it i realized that it was more of a series than one simple little video and so i was going to set up a big series little thing that i had a really clever name for but i completely forget what the the name of it is gonna be and realize that it's gonna take a little while to edit and so i did another video in the interim and then figured i'll get back to the other video that i recorded last week before this going to be turning into the series with clever name anyways it doesn't really matter because of the fact that i have to do this rant right now which if i ever get through the series and to the series and present the series to you then you will really really appreciate this rant because you have no idea and it's i mean it's not big well it's big to me okay so other people would just kinda probably sit back and laugh but right now i'm like ooh i have to do a rant i have to do a rant i have to do a rant or else my head's going to explode a couple of weeks ago i spent two days at my father's house setting up his dsl actually it was cable he already had cable but he still had dial up and so we had to switch the dial up and of course when you had to to switch it they didn't just let you get the the you know he was like he already has cable so that would be cool if you could just put your phone and cable and make those little bundles you know those little bundles but you had to upgrade the bundles in order to use the bundles he had cable but in order to get the bundle which had the high speed internet he had to upgrade his cable to digital cable and he had to upgrade his phone his regular phone to digital phone okay now the digital cable turned into he had to get a box and he had to do all this other stuff my father is like seventy something years old and he was pretty much you know what i really like what you i had before is there any way that i can keep it and basically the company was like no actually you can't because if you actually keep it you'll have to pay more i'm sorry did you just say i have to pay more for a lesser service um excuse me yeah so basically what you're telling me is that i can't just enjoy your service right now i have to have more and more and more so i have to have those little additional features or else i'm screwed better and better and better and fancier things and fancier things and more which is great for a seventy something year old you know because they don't need to have the stuff that they enjoy they have to have digital cable because you know their eyes really tell the difference between regular cable and digital cable oh and digital phone that's a brilliant idea more and did you know what did you know that if you have digital phone better and power goes out you can't call nine one one more and better isn't that fantastic i learned in california when the power went out we had all these blackouts these rolling blackouts because we were being screwed by some power company that when power goes out you can't use a cordless phone because it needs power in order to be used but i still had a landline phone so i was the only person in my apartment complex that could call anybody and so i had lines out my apartment for people who needed to call people because i was the only one that actually had the working phone and it's so great to know the fact that my seventy something year old father now cannot call nine one one because you know nine one one is less likely to be used when there's some major catastrophe that may result in power going out for extended periods of time and seventy something years old are you know less likely to trip and fall when they're walking around in the dark but the main point this main point that has just been the straw that's broken this little camel's back is that i spent two days two full days over there setting up his email with the the the new cause i had to upgrade he had dial up so i had to upgrade his email as well as the the the internet access so the internet access set up was great no problem but of course my seventy something year old father who who when you get to that age change is is is is is wants to use the same email program that he has been using for the past decade understandable it takes him two years to get used to a program so he wants to use the same program and this program is so ancient that if it were a person it would be like uh somebody that was in their prime in nineteen eighty three who is still trying to be that cool teenager that just ends up looking like a moron with big useless hair and ugly shoes and after those two days two days two days of doing this i get him all set up it was working beautifully well i just found out no more than ten minutes ago that my father having a minor problem called up customer service two days of forcing that program into a two thousand and nine bubble all lost lost bye bye all lost in thirty seconds lost by some girl not knowing what the bleep she's doing but can't admit that she's too lazy and not paid enough to really care well she decided to have my father erase all of the accounts and use the wizard wow aren't you brilliant aww use the wizard i wouldn't of thought to try that and oh if i did think of trying to use the wizard and it worked i think i would've said ah i rather set up everything manually what's the fun in using the automatic wizard when i can go through it manually step by step port by port pop three by pop three until my brain melts and oozes down the back of my throat searing multiple holes through by stomach and leaks out my bellybutton like flesh eating bacteria which then engulfs me like some geriatric cyberspace black hole on hemorrhoids woohoo hemorrhoids wow and i can just see this girl this julie julie julie julie julie whom for some reason i picture as chewing bubble gum with newly manicured tacky fingernails shoved so far up her bum you can file them through her nose julie not realizing that she is disintegrating the life span of some stranger by fifty years just like a drug pusher preying on innocent souls no it's okay go ahead delete it it won't hurt anything just delete all the accounts it's okay oh julie how could you do this to me and of course she's doing this all with a giggle and a perky sweet sweet smile perkily concluding well i can't seem to fix your problem today sir you'll have to contact your system administrator is there anything else i can do for you today you have no idea well julie julie julie come to think of it there is do you think i could get a lobotomy or is that considered an upgrade oh hey pumpkin you're aww you are so fired,,1337
688,and continues to be popular today and if you wanna know why he's called uncle milton that's actually the uh real name that he goes by now it's because this is a bad joke so don't blame me but he says that he was in charge of all the ants so then he must be the uncle all right i was coming to um a second question and that would be from adwena in edmonton and she asks um i heard that when you buy an ant farm it doesn't come with the ants that you have to get them later well that's true but you know what you don't have to get the ants yourself you can actually send away for them i believe all ant farms come with a certificate that you send in the mail and then a few weeks later you get a plastic vile of about ants now if you want to know where those ants come from there's actual jobs uh careers if you will of people who are calling themselves ant catchers and they pay about a little bit over a penny or a cent or depending on what country you're from maybe a couple of pesos i'm not too sure uh for an ant and it takes about ten hours to gather fifty thousand ants so if that a career you want to get into contact uncle milton cause uh maybe he could get you a job in ants i guess that would be ant ranching ant harvesting i don't know but there is a job out there for you if you want it all right last question is from uh francis in fort collins colorado and he asks why would anyone be interested in ant farms well obviously a lot of people are interested in ant farms francis or else it wouldn't be a really popular toy but i don't want a philosophical point of view on this you remember that little show called survivor that was real famous popular i'm sure you watched it francis that that's your answer all right we have our own little tv shows that could be metaphorical ant farms when you think about it like all those reality based shows are pretty much just human ant farms don't you think all right think about that one for a while that's it for this week go ahead and e mail me your suggestions questions or thoughts maybe you'd like to send in a photo of your own ant gallery your ants farm or your aunts and uncles who knows go ahead and send them my way and uh i'll be really appreciative and who knows maybe i'll get an ant farm myself and welcome to this is something we do every week on web waste world we pick a topic answer your question on that topic and you're so much smarter for it that you thank us in your will all right so the topic is on ant farms let's go ahead and get into the first question from patsy in plainfield connecticut and she asks who invented ant farms and why good question not a lot of people know the answer to this but i found out and of course it's the guy named milton levine nineteen fifties he was a distributer of ah novelties gag items including spud guns and rubber shrunken heads and he wanted to actually widen his merchandise and all of the sudden he came up with this great idea in nineteen fifty six he went to a picnic with his family and noticed how little kids love to put ants in mason jars with dirt and then watch them dig tunnels and sure enough he decided,,626

694,hi everybody how you doing it's from today in the catholic church was the feast of the immaculate conception what's the immaculate conception well a lot of catholics will mistakenly tell you that it was the conception of jesus i used to think that myself but that's not true that's a totally different event that was the annunciation the feast of the immaculate conception was the conception of our blessed mother into the womb of saint anne her mother well what was so immaculate about that you might ask well we're going to have to go back in time to adam and eve the very first two people on earth now we all know the story adam and eve they ate the fruit and they caused humanity to fall into sin okay so therefore as punishment every offspring of eve and adam would be born into sin that includes you and i and all of our children and our children's children okay so we are all born in original sin we have that on our souls that's why that's the purpose of baptism to get rid of that sin all right now we believe that god spared our lady of being born with original sin this is all of us pretend we're these soda cans okay just imagine pretend that these are people okay and then this bowl here has a lot of popcorn in it uh is sin okay when we're born we fall into the we fall into the original sin okay can you hear that these are this is us when we're our conceptions okay all of us all of us are into that are are born with that original sin okay all of us woo woo woo alright now when it was mary's turn jesus being mary's savior did save her he spared her into going into the original sin from being born into the original sin so yes he is still her savior it just worked a little bit differently alright her she was born with she was born sinless okay thanks to jesus god and the holy spirit thanks to the holy trinity okay so jesus is her savior the rest of us were redeemed by jesus after our births with baptism confession and everything uh if anyone's interested in seeing a movie about it there's a great one i recommend it's called um the song of bernadette it's in black and white but it's a beautiful beautiful picture go to blockbuster go to hollywood video they all have it um check the uh i guess the oldie movies or something like that it was made in like i don't know like the fifties or sixties or something like that it's black and white but um beautiful picture and he explains it explains what the whole our lady of lords and the immaculate conception is alright i hope i didn't cause any more confusion with that i tried to do my best but thank you anyway and have a great week,,507

703,good afternoon it's saturday august twenty ninth my name is my youtube name is and i'm broadcasting to you from perth west australia this week on the we'll be describing our favorite places of art all the while participating and accepting one of the challenges i'm going to accept a challenge of describing my painting without using a particular word my favorite piece of artwork is a painting by a local west australian artist called ellen norton and the painting is called man receiving insights the painting is a very simple painting there are only three elements there's a man a dog and the setting norton has painted the setting as a typical australian beach from the north of our suburbs from the north of our country so in the immediate foreground we've got the red dirt of our out back and beyond that we've got the yellow sand of our beaches a crystallized blue waters typical of our oceans and above that our brilliant blue skies and now i'm going to attempt to act out for you the other two elements the dog and the man so first of all we'll start with the dog now the dog is painted on the left of the painting about the middle and he's sitting on the bench he's down on all four hunches he's got a long mouth and i think this norton has painted this long mouth because it sort of retains a kind of an embarrassing sort of look and then the only other element of the painting is the man now norton's painted him with a white fluffy cap because you've got to depict yourself in these as suburban and norton has painted this man with his back to us and he's doing this that's right he's leaping for joy now norton's included a little ticket here she's painted the man nude so it's these elements that i really find attractive about this painting it's the simpleness of the construction it's the hanged dog embarrassed dog and it's the man who's naked he's leaping for joy he's received insight he's experienced a eureka moment i think that norton has so effectively planted this that the metaphor that i interested was that like how casting aside his clothes the man's realized that he's going to cast aside your inhibitions you can experience joy and eureka moments so i hope you've enjoyed my description i hope that you might be able to find a link to the painting somewhere on the please check out my channel bye,,427

705,hi i'm making my first advice video um a little bit earlier than i intended and it is for fan who video responded my last video asking me a question um before i do that before i give her my advice i would just like to clarify that you want me to give you advice you don't need to upload video unless you want to um you can just e mail me at ask marbles at gmail com and stay totally anonymous if you want just sign in as you'd like me to refer to you as does that make any sense i don't know if my voice sounds a little bit weird i woke up with a cold today boo so she asks me um what do i do when people make fun of me because i like twilight um you know i have i myself obviously have received a lot of um teasing not just from uh people i don't know but like friends and family and you know a lot from guys lots of guys ohhh you like that twilight stuff well especially from people who haven't even actually read the books or seen the movie they're just sick of seeing it everywhere and kind of approach it as high school musical but for like emo children mm i don't know basically you just gotta keep in mind that it's not actually personal and that really the person they're making fun of is themselves especially in the case of them having not read the book or seen the movie i mean people are entitled to their opinions obviously but no one should ever make fun of you for liking something that they don't unless it's done kind of you know playfully and people will always tease each other about that kind of thing like um growing up i always used to make fun of my younger brother for liking mighty machines cause i thought it was the most boring show of life basically so the best thing you can do in that situation whether it be uh in the comments on the video or or some random person at school who's commenting on your team edward shirt or a family member or whatever is just keep in mind well everyone is entitled to their own opinion and you can say that look them dead in the eye when you say that everyone's entitled to their own opinion there isn't much more they can say to that because you're not even when you're disagreeing with them you're kinda agreeing to disagree and don't let other people you know knock you down just over something you happen to like in the end their opinion when it comes to your interest doesn't matter i think that helps so click update while i'm uh making this video real quick i've gotten a lot of responses to the book club thing and i'm going to say the ones that are up for votes will be obviously the one hundred names the immortal instruments series and anything by john green those seem to be the three most popular so in comments throw out which of the three you would prefer to have me talk about and maybe you have advice for aj probably you should give it to her as well i'm going to well obviously make this a video response to her video but until that happens i'll also link her video on the side so ahh good times i'm sorry i wish i was more energetic oh oh and by the way everybody who's been sending me private messages of encouragement thank you so much i do read them i do and um i'm trying to reply to all of them and i do read all your comments as well and i appreciate every piece of encouragement i've received so peace out peace out really it's come to that hasn't it,,660
706,ladies and gentlemen how're you all doing my name is and i look for opportunities um you know uh just a lot of stuff's been going on which is why i haven't really posted a video in a while um just a lotta a lotta a lotta family stuff and friends and whatnot anyways um you know it's bad stuff but you know you gotta move on from it so that's what i'm doing um it's some of you guys i don't know just so you guys know i'm a hundred seventy two pounds now um but that's probably because of the stress so not necessarily a good uh eating habit um i've been working out a lot more every morning i do about uh thirty to fifty pushups uh just to get my day going and then i try to do a little workout throughout the day um so you know just that's just a little update for you guys i'm sorry i didn't really you know uh go with the daily blogs all the time but um i'm just letting you guys know a hundred seventy two pounds i'm working out pretty much every day now and um you know it's pretty good um and yesterday i uh was helping my friend and his brother film something for his girlfriend um it's like a micro christmas thing and i am going i might put that on this channel it's not like i have any other channel to put it on but i might put it on here kind of i think you know i was filming it and stuff like that and i felt a little direct and it was it was a lot of fun so uh hopefully you guys will see that pretty soon um anyway i have a lot more raps that i would love to get out and a lot more songs that i'd love to get out so um that's kind a what this channel's turning into a lot of rap and songs and blogs um i used my skip but i just don't have time to skipping right now um but anyway um you know that's enough out of me so thanks for watching and stay healthy and i hope you have a happy holiday if i don't talk to you before and yeah that's it you guys have a good one,,400
707,hey guys it's me i know i i think i said in my last video i was going to shave off my mustache but somebody commented on it saying it looked like the anti hitler because hitler had the um hair in the middle and on my hair i have no hair here at all it seems to be curling out the side like this so i decided to keep it you know for a couple more weeks or so though i'd shave it off because if i shave it off i look a lot younger and i'm twenty one and i want to look as young as possible you know um so yeah uh basically oh i got one more thing before i start on my actual topic that i'm going to do today i think adam lambert got robbed on american idol he should've won it should've been danny and adam in the bottom i mean in the top two bottom two should've been danny and adam in the top two with adam winning or even if danny won it would've seemed more realistic than kris allen winning i think kris allen is a little bit gonna get my shirt words on it uh i think kris allen's not that good of a performer he doesn't really live to the name of an american idol neither does taylor hicks season five i thought he was just like you know one of the joke kind of contestants like sanjaya was in season six and i can't think of any other ones offhand but you know what i mean um yeah so anyways i work at taco bell and i've worked there for about a year and a half now and strangely enough i enjoy working there i know it seems strange like oh my god someone actually works likes working for a fast food well yes i do i enjoy it and cause really it's not just the whole job aspect that i enjoy i actually like the people i work with they're so laid back and they're so you know accepting of me as a person as well as you know my situations that i had been put in situations that i have that i will discuss later on with you guys and my boss is very lenient with my schedule and understands all my situations pretty well and i'm thankful for that and you know a job is a job no matter what you should be thankful that you even have a job no matter how low in the food chain that job is and i get a paycheck every two weeks and i'm fine i mean i can survive on what i get i can make it work and oh and you're probably all wondering the background like you have a coca cola room trust me it's not my idea i swear but i'll go into why my room is like this in another video anyways back on topic um so yeah i like my job cause it's actually and there's a lot of diverse people at the taco bell that i work at mexican people black people gay people me a couple of people are bisexuals there um men women children well not children minors you know old young middle age and even have our own little pet ducks at work too so i know it seems kinda odd but my boss takes care of the ducks outside of the drive thru and we use all the food that we don't need all the anything that's dried up or old we just you know tear up we put it in a thing called a duck box and we set the duck box outside and the little ducks come and eat their uh eat the food so yeah it's kinda cool and i think i'm very lucky to have the job that i have with the people that i work with cause the people that i work with are probably one in a million the crew is probably one in a million chance that i would work with them because they're so funny and nice and and and you know team huge team players yeah we all make mistakes but you know who doesn't make mistakes i mean it's just a great place it's a great environment and i that's surprising considering i live in california but i'm not going to get into that i like california i do but certain places in it scare me to death so that's why i don't travel that much anywhere in california i practically stay in stockton here most of the time um so yeah that's about it that's about what i do you're probably thinking oh god this blog is kinda boring i'm well i promise you once i get all the personal stuff about myself personal stuff about myself out of the way then i'll start diving into some of the other topics like how i came out that's probably really juicy that's a funny story about how i came out and why i came out and who i came out to and what was the background behind that and you know it was really funny it's actually kinda work related too so yeah so guys i hope you guys have a good summer cause school's out amongst other things i'm out school's out i came out saying here schools out see how that works i know that's kind boring whoop dee doo anyways um so i hope to see you guys later maybe in a couple of days i wanna try to do these blogs as frequently as i possibly can i've just been really really busy with work but now that everyone is out of school i should be able to do these at least once or twice a week and i trust me i'll have subjects galore for these blogs and um i hope you guys will subscribe and follow me that's twitter something different huh anyways yeah in the description box this way no this way right no this way i couldn't remember it's sorta like a mirror image so i'm pointing the wrong way in the description box on this side over here this way i don't know how to do that right then um you'll find the link to my myspace so if you want to friend request me on myspace go ahead post a comment do whatever you want uh yeah so that's about it for this blog for today ciao,,1101
708,bonjour hey twilighters it's friday and today is fantastic because i went to walmart and right in the door i saw these really crazy like bottles of soda i'm like oh it's so cute it's a little ornament so i'm actually going to make an ornament out of this bottle of soda it seriously is a bottle of soda look now woo ah so this week is probably a week that i do not want to remember ever this is the last week i'll get to see sana hopefully i'll be able to see her either tomorrow or sometime next week before she leaves i don't want her to go but let's not talk about goodbyes because it's never really goodbye we're always going to be friends and hello skype it's going to be sad not hanging out with her all the time so i went to see new moon again it's like gets better every time i see it it really cracks me up because i am just in love with the idea of face punch face punch i love it plus the fact that it's blatantly making fun of hollywood action films i still think it's fucking hilarious so i did a face punch trailer just for you guys i have some challenges i need to get out of the way both of these challenges are from challenge numero uno challenged me to go into a bookstore and find as many books as i possibly can on vampires well i haven't been able to go to a bookstore recently so i went to borders dot com and found several vampire titles including the vampire diaries the vampire academy cirque du freak interview with a vampire the thirst novels the coffin club and dance of the vampire those were just a few i found there are so many more out there and actually it makes me wonder if you write a novel about vampires is it going to be published because it's popular i think i just figured out how i'm going to get my book published the subject vampires ta da instant bestseller no i don't know but i just think that there are so many it's kind of freaking me out that there are so many vampire novels actually out there and i do like a few challenge numero dos also challenged me to make a attractive face like rob did in one of his recent interviews so here goes nothing so also when i went in to go see new moon again i realized how much i freaking love michael sheen to the point where i just wanted to hug him he's freaking awesome as aro and i realized that i didn't put him on my list of things that i liked about new moon so i wanted to kind of dedicate this blog to his awesomeness seriously when michael sheen came onscreen as aro i thought i was going to die because he just kind of took over that portion of the movie his acting was superb and actually it fit exactly how i imagined aro in the books he was so intimidating yet very like welcoming at the same time and i couldn't quite pinpoint why i felt like drawn to him and yet repulsed by him at the same time so um i thought i'd bring this up right now um fifty book challenge for this year has officially failed for me i think i read like ten and actually i just got done reading this book it's called guitar girl by sarra manning it's really good and i i just enjoyed it because it was like all about the real story of a teen band and how fame kind of corrupted people and basically it's about how people aren't really what they seem to be in real life and people are just out for money and for themselves and it's really good i just i teared up at the end it was really cute next i will be reading this book whoo hoo i'm jumping on the bandwagon no seriously i've been meaning to read it for a while but y'all are saying how awesome it is so i'm going to read it don't know what this is it's like reading ninja whoo reading ninja friday i will see you twilighters again and um monday maybe maybe if not i'll see you on tuesday or before,,744
709,hey guys sorry it's been so long since i last posted a video i really got caught up in basically school i mean how clich is that everybody's caught up in school right now i noticed that a lot of users users ha no people who make youtube videos um they stop making videos for a few weeks when the school year starts so hopefully you know people haven't been wondering where i was and thinking that i wasn't gonna come back but i'm back and i'm really going to try and start making videos more consistently it was just during the summer that i had a lot of time to uh waste not that youtube's wasting my time ha so basically i've been doing school taking a sewing class at this art school i go to and it's really cool it's a little bit overwhelming cause i've never really used a machine before and i'm just like rrr pch pch pch i really want to do fashion design as my future and i figured okay well maybe i should sew so that i know what i'm doing obviously i was really bored one night and i just took a scissors to the face head region i kinda wanted a whole betty page look you know like forties pinup so hopefully that's what comes across because i just want to look like a calendar girl bimbo all the time and there's so many times where i was like i should make a video i'm like well i'll just read this book i was reading this book called shiver i don't know if anybody else has read it if you have leave me a comment telling me what you thought of it because i was kind of half and half with it cause it's a stephanie meyer ripoff with the whole werewolf true love thing umm it was kind of jacobish ey and then kind of an edward thing mixed in like i can't love you cause you're a werewolf vampire and we can't be together it was like we'll find a way oh low battery crapface i'm just gonna stop it here and then so this is shiver um if i was going love hate society ratings i would probably rate a three maybe like three and a half cause it definitely was inspired by twilight and cause the whole werewolf vampire obsession thing really wasn't so romantic before cause the whole idea of falling in love with a werewolf was never quite that appealing until twilight came along i made the mistake of trying to make these freaking pompom things i hate them like oh gosh if anybody knows how to make these then please give me the most dumbed down directions that you can possibly ever give a person because i can't understand directions for crap i ended rolling this whole thing and then cutting it and the the whole thing just fell apart after after i've been rolling this yarn for about err two hours yeah two hours and then the whole thing just fell apart so i kind of like cried and screamed and stomped around the house and um physically abused the sock it's got some dents uh that's how i deal with my rage eh i started watching america's next top model and i started watching it and i was shocked cause this is season or cycle thirteen and it's for short people and i have nothing against short people i think that short people are beautiful um just as beautiful as someone who is tall sometimes short people are prettier than tall people but for real like it's just sorry you can't really be a model if you're really short it just doesn't happen and it kind of made the show even lamer than it already is cause tyra is just such a freak now like i i think tyra banks is really nice and stuff but every show she just gets weirder and weirder like what was it the first episode she was talking in a french accent half of the time and one season before i know that she was dressed up like a princess and she put on a skit with the mister and misses jays or whatever they are and they were like prince charming and miss jay was a witch or something it was the weirdest thing and i was just like wow this show is really desperate um and then there was a space themed one it was it's getting really weird and over the top i'm gonna to cry right now i'm really sad meh what do you think of my fringe a lot of people don't think i look the same but you know hey i'm the same because every single subscriber means so much to me so um yeah oh and the channel um i feel horrible about that too the channel really hasn't been it's on hiatus basically like quit and then we all decided to take a break and then was gonna come back when we're all done with the break and it's been a while and we we're gonna make a video saying that we're going on break but that never happened and we're just all very scattered and i don't know i think that we'll work out but we're not really sweating it right now cause we really don't want to be like you know uff collab channel nazis and um we're just gonna chill for a while and maybe during christmas break or or something we'll start making videos again but i really hope that nobody unsubscribes because it is a really good channel and i think that we have a lot potential but we're all a bunch of teenagers who still go to high school and have kind of crazy lives so um hang in there with us and we'll be posting videos um when we're all finally settled down so yeah thank you for watching this really long video i hope that you didn't die of boredom but yeah i'll talk to you guys later bye,,1029

711,welcome to this is part one of four counting down the top thirty one videos of the entire year youtube has this new page out youtube dot com slash newyears where every day they put out a new video and it's super fun and exciting it's the entire reason i stay up late waiting to see the new video get posted so let's go right into it and cover the videos that have already been released i doubt this is in any particular order i think it's just by the day all these videos are total collectively best videos of two thousand nine first video mister guitar man awesome i loved joe his video guitar impossible now i love this video for the technical expertise obviously in the editing and everything else but personally i wish they would have chosen the one with the water glasses playing them with the pens because that was my favorite that joe put out this year i just fell in love with that video second video is biscuit the sleepwalking dog you knew that viral video was gonna be in this list somewhere and it came out the second day it's where the dog is sleeping and starts running and then like wakes itself up and runs into the wall and it's hilarious and it's so cute another one you knew was gonna be up there fred his one million subscribers video i think it's interesting how of all the fred videos they chose that one but obviously they would because it was the first person ever to get a million subscribers on the website so congratulations fred obviously you had an amazing two thousand nine the fourth video is the know you're mean boxy video and special bonus they linked to original boxy video um can you believe that boxy came out in january so it's pretty much been a year since boxy came onto the scene that just blows my mind the fifth video that came out was a video i've never even seen so it was kind of interesting to get to watch one of the popular videos of two thousand nine for the first time it's the guild's alluring avatar it was a really funny video i liked it but yeah it was good i i wish i had known about it cause it's one of those weird things where it's like i've never seen this before and now i'm being told it's one of the top videos of two thousand nine hmm i don't know how i feel about that but obviously if you've seen you agree with it because it is a very well done video so congratulations to the guild i don't mean holding his toothpaste wasn't in the shot just then the sixth video came from shane dawson tv obviously two thousand nine we've all said was the year of the dawson and um no surprise they were gonna put him on the list but i'm very surprised that they chose his very emotional and serious father's day video yes the beginning is very funny but it turns very serious and very personal very quickly and i think that day that video came out we all got to see for the first time a very personal side of shane and it was such a blessing for him to share that with us and i am very surprised that put that out there i'm really glad they did because i think it's awesome that he shared that with us and you know there lot's of people out there that don't have fathers and can very much relate to that situation um but i would've thought youtube would very much keep every thing very you know lively and happy and the fact that they you know took it serious and you know not everything is happy go lucky on youtube as in life um i'm very uh proud of them and yeah i think it was a good thing that they chose that video the seventh video that came out was united breaks guitars ouch um this video is just about this guy singing about how united broke his guitar he's a band i've never heard of a video i've never seen um and the video i'm sorry not really impressed six million views impressive good job on you know getting a viral video out there and uh the whole theme of this day i guess of putting this video out was oh clever way to get attention to a problem yeah but united didn't solve those problems so it really wasn't that great and if the video was a little better united would've replaced his guitar ooo bad the video they put out today the only one we have left to talk about is we fail is a big win um yes i absolutely remember all of those we fail videos of people not having their wrist strap on and throwing the little chuck and into the tv it went and oh my goodness all those plasma high def tv screens that got ruined this year because of the wi oh lordy don't even get me started on that money but thank god i've never done that because i don't own a wi but if i did you know that strap would be on my wrist at all times i do not have to ruin my tv but yeah hilarious hilarious videos i'm glad they chose that because and that was kind of a very viral thing at the beginning of this year wasn't it i feel like it was those are all the videos that they've released so far you need to go and check out and bookmark so you can see them come out every day next tuesday will be part two where i'll cover the next seven videos that they've released in those seven consecutive days uh thank you so much for watching um be sure to come back on friday for and i'm really just kind of excited for you to come back next week because i'm really excited to see the next seven days and i can't wait to see the rest of the videos that are the top thirty one of the year uh i'm very excited obviously

713,hi i would like to bring to your attention a new type of hatred emo bashing twice over the past two days that's once a day i have been subjected to this by what i refer to as nazi aryan elitists the most shocking thing about all of this i'm not even emo apparently because i dye my hair listen to fallout boy my chemical romance and all american rejects dress in skull themed black clothing and refer to myself as emo on myspace facebook bebo and as much as possible these conformist pigs have labeled me an emo but what is emo bashing well i'll give you two examples first of all i was at this party and i'd sabotaged this music system to play nothing but real music and this chick was like uh what's with all the emo music and i found this really hurtful and really really super unfair so i turned around and said to her what's wrong with emos and then she responded and i'm not exaggerating oh my cat i'm not exaggerating because i'm not exaggerating just to make my stories more credible but she said emos they're all whiney arrogant self absorbed losers and it doesn't help that they look ridiculous well here's my well thought out response that i responded with maybe i said it at the time or i thought it up later don't be sassy you obviously are too closed minded to understand anything you capitalist how can you judge people based on a biased opinion like that how many emos did you even know none then how can you make blanket assumptions about their personalities unned and i mean i don't mean to compare the mild dislike of the subculture as something as serious as racism but this is tantamount to racism i mean look at slavery if george washington or whoever was in charge of that had sat down and talked to some slaves maybe he would have liked them i mean rap music does suck but it's still possible and then this morning some chick outed me from myspace and she was like really rude she told me that my blogs were really retarded and that i need to get a life because i didn't have one i was so angry that i skipped university to make this video blog what a bi,,397
714,okay so it's not kind of shining but just forget that um hello everybody i am making a video because i have nothing else to do but i really don't know what to talk about so i'm just going to go with the flow here first of all look at my amazing shirt it's a peace shirt i got that from hot topic when i went oh i went out of town this past week and i went to um with my mom and yeah i had a lot of fun it's kinda boring cause like you know i'm vegetarian right and it's like really really hard to find a vegetarian alternative at places you know cause you usually i don't eat out anymore really i used to eat stuff at the house so it was kind of tricky with that i think i probably lost a couple of pounds but yeah so that is all with that my mom did pretty good i think and yeah so i don't really i don't really have anything really have anything going on right now um yeah let's see my birthday is coming up very soon but it is actually a friend of mine's birthday his name is ryan and um i was going to say happy birthday on here and so happy birthday and he probably doesn't watch this but i don't really care i'm just going to say it anyways but my birthday is real soon i'll be seventeen i think i already said that on my past video i don't know but i'm getting excited for it and this is great news everybody i am not afraid to talk on the phone anymore and i got a skype so anybody who wants my skype or something or just wants to talk to me on skype ask me and i will give it to you okay and we'll talk on there so yeah that was probably all for now just a little update you know stuff like that uh phbbbth don't know my hair i my hair earlier and it's becoming like an afro really bad and i don't know what to do i want to get a haircut but i don't want it really short because this is with gel and it looks good with gel still and then like a little a little uh like frizzy but that's about it so yeah i will probably make another video soon and i will talk to you all later,,419
715,hello internet i just can't concentrate on anything anymore here i am i have a quick question and that question is do you know what the project for awesome is if you don't go to this link and read about the project for awesome if you do i can go right into the question i'm going to ask what charities do you support if you are not taking part in the project for awesome this year i need to know what charities you guys think are most important i already have a couple that i support but i need one specific charity not really picky about what it supports that i can do for the project for awesome this year i was going to do one last year and i was going to do save darfur but i never got around to making the videos so i kind of you know just put it on hold but this year i really really really want to do project for awesome so i need your input what charities do you guys think are the most important leave me a comment send me a video response or message and let me know what you guys think i have two youtube accounts so i might do two videos we'll see what happens but i need to know what you guys think and i'll compare your responses with what i already had in mind and we'll go from there if my head looks a little bit weirder than normal it's because i got a haircut and it's really short it's a little bit shorter than i hoped and i've had a hat on all day so it looks really weird but i don't know i'm kind of getting used to it that's the beard i guess i don't know for some reason my beard doesn't grow as well as shay carl's does so i'm never going to have an awesome fuzzy grizzly adams beard like shay what else happened i went on a hunting trip with my dad we saw about seven deer total one small buck and six doe including the one that ran out in front of us as we were driving home from the bar i saw some cougar tracks and we also had a verbal argument with a porcupine which was kind of exciting i also got blu ray from wal mart they had it priced at twenty bucks and it rang up as fifteen it really surprised me because this one comes with the blu ray the special features and this is where the regular dvd goes people are actually watching it downstairs and it also comes with the digital copy let's see it says there right there on the back i was really really excited to get this because on the special features they have footage from the deathly hollows if you haven't bought it yet i recommend doing so if you guys don't already know i'm a hardcore harry potter fanatic and i was sitting here yesterday and i was watching the movie i started to get really really giddy and excited and when i watched the footage from the deathly hollows and i kind of a did a little face palm because i realized i was trying to do what one of those twilight fans would do and then i realized that harry potter is so much better than twilight on every level imaginable and i felt okay about it again if you guys haven't checked out averagewizard com do so it's really cool it's kind of like that fmls and the mlia for harry potter fanatics and there's a twilight one as well but i've been you know staying away from it because it's twilight i mean i enjoyed the books when i read them but this whole fan base is just ridiculous harry potter teaches to overcome adversity and keep your friends close and you know to treasure life twilight teaches pedophilia and bestiality seven up is the best drink ever i used to be obsessed with sierra mist and then i started drinking seven up again and it's actually a little bit better for you i mean it's still pop soda fizzy drink whatever you guys call it where you're from it's not good for you at all in general but over sprite and coke and sierra mist and pepsi this is actually better for you because it's all natural flavors and there's really no additives other than corn syrup so i really like seven up but i'm trying to get off pop completely i know i'm kind of late in the dedication to december so i'll like start that on the fifteenth and just do half way through december and january oh one more thing this new year's i'm going down to pittsburg to spend that period of time with my guitarist kevin and his wife hilary and kevin and i are going to be recording some tracks if you guys haven't checked us out on myspace i'm going to put the link right here at the bottom be sure to check this out add us and listen to the tracks that kevin has already laid down none of my vocal tracks are up there just yet i haven't had really a chance to record anything good my house is always full of people and it's just you know hard to record anything here so when i go down there we're going to get some recording done and we will have a studio ep within the coming months so keep an ear out for us add us on myspace we're going to have a youtube where we're hopefully going to have some unplugged taped stuff so who knows and if you like it you do and if you don't well tell us tell us why you don't like it maybe we can do something that suites your taste thanks for watching and i will see you guys later peace,,1006
716,hey youtube it's here how many bloody times have you heard a theist say something like this well if you don't believe in god then where do you get your morality from yeah we've all heard derivatives of this from the likes of douche bags like william lane craig ravi zacharias etcetera etcetera indeed christians like to bleat this like the sheep that they are ad nauseum i know this is a tired topic but bear with me okay now i've heard some needlessly ornate rebuttals to this usually utilizing some convoluted philosophical principle that underlines the philosophy of their argument but as most of you know by now don't go in for all of that fancy book learning i'm a pretty simple guy and i'm gonna give you all some common sense here okay when asked where do you get your morality from i usually give a quick answer and that is from the same place you do myself and today i'm going to prove it to you now my morality as i said is from myself essentially it's more complicated than that but the bottom line is i assess situations and make moral decisions based on my experience and i judge something to be immoral or moral i am the filter now many theists especially christians and muslims subscribe to the idea of divine command theory now in a nutshell divine command theory says that god defines what is moral and immoral therefore if god commands something it is therefore moral by definition now i'm gonna disregard for a moment here in that god's existence has yet to be established and so no one's in a position to say what god has or has not said at least from a scriptural perspective well let's just deal with the claim itself let me give mr hypothetical christian a hypothetical scenario let's say that one day mr hypothetical christian is in prayer and as he is praying all of a sudden he is blinded by a light and he hears a booming voice and he says mr christian yes lord is that you speaking to me in an audible voice yes it is what an honor lord mr christian there is an old woman named thelma johnson who lives at seventy thirty six autobahn street in your home town i am commanding you to go and buy her a bouquet of flowers deliver them to her and tell them i asked you to do this i promise you will be blessed i the lord have spoken oh wow lord i can't believe this this is incredible thank you so then mr hypothetical christian goes and does exactly that goes and buys a bouquet of flowers and brings them to mrs johnson now upon hearing that god asked mr hypothetical christian to bring her the flowers mrs johnson is elated she starts crying they embrace and start praising god together now mr christian granted you may never have experienced anything like this but what you're say that this is a reasonable scenario i've drawn out here that if in fact you heard that voice you would do that right yeah i suppose so yeah that sounds good certainly it would be pretty amazing to hear god's voice audibly i mean he usually doesn't work that way but yeah that would be wonderful sure what a faith affirming thing that would be okay fair enough what if you do a different scenario suppose same day you're praying blinding light booming voice only this time here's what you hear mr christian yes lord oh my gosh are you speaking to me audibly yes mr christian there is a man living in van nuys california whose very life is an affront to me he has done wickedness in my sight and is very dangerous i have chosen you as my emissary of divine justice go now and find mr edgar schnalverdoff he lives at one twenty nine cedar street in van nuys find him and kill him by whatever means necessary tell no one of your quest once his life is at an end i will see to it that the authorities do not suspect you and great will your reward be in heaven i the lord have spoken huh so okay mr hypothetical christian now i pose you this second question would you do that nah uh no why not are you saying god is wrong or is asking you to do something immoral no you'd get it god would never command you to do an evil action like that really but you just heard a booming voice you saw a blinding light there was no one else in your house clearly it'sgod speaking to you and asking you to do this right no you don't get it mr atheist the point is that even if i heard the booming voice and all that and it wasn't god it was a demon posing as god because he asked me to commit a wicked action a crime murder what is wrong with you atheists thank you you're just proving my point did you catch it when mr hypothetical christian was asked to bring flowers to mrs johnson he was enthralled that god has chosen him to speak to audibly he immediately went and did exactly as he was told brought her the flowers and it was an incredible faith affirming event they were crying praising god and so on right but when mr hypothetical christian was asked to go kill edgar schnalverdoff he then does not do what he's asked and in fact says that the booming voice was not god but a demon in disguise because god would never ask him to commit such a crime all right so let's distill this down now booming voice says give flowers to old lady good must be god i'm gonna do it booming voice says go kill a man not good must be not god but a demon in disguise not gonna do it well mr hypothetical christian you just use your own moral faculties to assess the situation and make a moral decision therefore i am correct by saying you and i use the same moral barometers that's why you are baseless by saying to me that as an atheist i have no basis for my morality i have the same fucking basis that you do and something else i wanna add i don't just you know just make moral decisions just based on how i feel on a given day no i have my whole life experience all that i've seen in my short thirty two years on this planet but i also have history i have other people's experiences to go on and collectively we can come to an understanding as to what we think is going to be good for everyone and what is going to be bad and you know what a lot of shit is very complicated and it's not easy to always know what is the fully moral decision and what is the immoral decision but you know what though by and large we do pretty much agree the fact is i think it's pretty simple whatever causes the least amount of suffering as much as it depends on you do that whatever is going to bring joy and happiness to people do that whatever's gonna cause harm to any sentient being either animals or human beings avoid that as much as possible now granted it's not always easy to do this and it's not always easy to know which is going to result in those things but that should be what we all strive to do and if you need to be told why we should even do that why suffering is bad and joy is good you're a fucking sociopath and i've got no time for you so just something to think about thanks for watching,,1330

719,so this would be attempt number three for this evening which looks like six when i do it this way but really it's like emphasis on three i had recorded once the one time before i decided to give it a whirl a second time to see if i liked it better i didn't i decided on the first one but apparently that was too long for youtube which i didn't find out until after it was like you know converted and uploaded and viewed so now you see me after you know i've removed my makeup and my jewelry and stuff so hi and i've done some weird stuff to my hair which you won't get to see because that was in the other video but uh i'm gonna do some more weird things because i'm deciding to go with a different you know vibe entirely this one's gonna be about knitting this hat so um let's start with the first one so when you get ready to knit they usually tell you you have to swatch stuff which is more important when you're making a garment like you know sweater or something to wear like a skirt i guess there are a lot of garments you can make i haven't made them cause i stick with hats and scarves cause they're small projects and get done quickly and i'm satisfied with that so uh anyway there was this hat pattern at um i'm sleeping don't mind me um there was this hat pattern at knitty's com that i decided i wanted to try and so i didn't have the appropriate needle size so i figured well i'll just go up one it shouldn't be a big deal because i knit pretty tight most of the time anyway which some of you who have gotten hats can probably attest to right uh anyway so i went up in needle size and and i didn't swatch and i decided to make a large pattern version too and a hat that is supposed to pretty fitted for you know like fitted around here turned out like this so um yeah swatching not always a bad thing even for hats and let's see which one of these is the right one okay so then there was this other one this other pattern at knitty's that i wanted to try cause it looked kinda cool and it's also a hat and uh sometimes patterns are wrong there was a misprint and there's a particular if you'll note see these triangly sections here like this one in the middle right here that's that's a single patterny thing i'm not sure how to describe it and a i'm doing a horrible job of it but you repeat this a certain number of times in order to complete the hat well the directions called for completing the first one and then doing it four more times well when you do it four more times this is what you get and see like this there's room in here and technically that's supposed to be flipped up so it looks like that but still see wide so i figured this out i have been debating a weird point my mom had wanted me to make a hat for her dad that was similar only different colors and so they were trying to figure out like what the problem was like did i need to go down a needle size had i knit too loosely which is would be a new problem was a possibility so i finally figured out that it was probably supposed to be a total repeat of four and not like five which is what that one was so i tried it again and it's much better and also appropriate ta da but you know apparently when it's looking too big on the needles that might be a good time to check for sure which is kinda hard to tell cause that was straight knitting like on straight needles and then cleaning it up i hate cleaning stuff up by the way but it's necessary for it to align also side note this is this is not gonna mean much probably to most of you if you don't knit but um and now i'm trying to remember what this is called actually short rows that's right so these are achieved by very short rows well the first time i heard about short rows was in conjunction with um it was like a lingerie pattern and so it was making a bust line which is kinda like you know it was like three per cup more or less but you know for girls to go into so the entire time i'm knitting i feel like you know i'm in fifth grade because i snicker every so often thinking about the possibility that in reality cause when you around the needles they kinda go out a little like kinda like oh that's hard to tell anyway kinda like that i keep thinking of seeing the you know short rows being done and it's in order to create a cup to create for a bust and so so i'm totally immature snickering away while i'm knitting and you know i'm sure if anyone was around would've been looking at me peculiar oddly anyway so that was my knitting gone wrong i haven't actually done much knitting since then i've got like a scarf on the needles right now that's a secret thing that i need to get back to but it's so tedious cause it's like it's it's smaller than i'm used to it's on size eight again probably doesn't mean much to most of you and some of you are probably going nuts not because if you've seen some of the socks i've yet to make to make a sock and i'm going to stop talking about knitting now because no one is interested instead since i've had to move stuff to get the laptop set up where it was at on my bed that means my sunglasses were there so these are actually the ones i wear most of the time not the blue ones in the previous you know video and these actually cause look at the size of this piece right that's pretty big it won't fit in my purse without removing a lot of other stuff from it if i wear these out they usually wind up on my head if i'm like you know going in somewhere where i don't want to wear them cause they're not really see through they're kinda well they're see through cause they're sunglasses duh but they're they're kinda dark so um wearing them into retail locations and such is not always a good idea so they they usually live up here when they're not in my case but um i'm not sure how energy this is turning up to be i must admit i'm a wee bit sleepy not really sleepy sleepy but i'm kinda i can be more up and i had to have caffeine today to function speaking of which you'll have likely read about the whole trip to penney's yeah already so i was told yesterday that i had to be ready to leave at one thirty and we weren't going to be leaving til two but i had to be out of the bathroom by one thirty which usually takes me an hour to get all set and done in there cause i'm a girl or something i am a girl i'm not something i'm a girl right so anyway i had i had been awoken or woken up at uh about well earlier this morning than i wanted to get up i'm not going to tell you what time cause it's pretty sad anyway there was the industrial size riding lawnmower outside my window there's a quiet thick expanse of grass out here outside my window and because it stretches on for you know quite you can tell with the slides here because i'm indicating my window so that you can see windows to my span fun right so there's a lot of grass out there and uh the mowing went on for forty five minutes before i could hear it and i tried to go back to sleep and it didn't really work until like you know closer to the time where i needed to get up which obviously now that i've told you i had to be ready by one thirty and it takes me an hour you're guessing right that i had to be up by at least twelve thirty to go in the shower which i was up sooner than that because i had to get up you know and do some other stuff but anyway so i eventually fell back asleep and got about thirty minutes in and woke up later than i had been planning but it worked out more or less anyway i had gotten sufficiently less sleep than i had planned on i had gotten about an hour less than i had desired so um which when i'm sleeping about six hours anyway i i need that you know five five is kinda pushing it for functioning really well six i can manage to swing so i had gotten around five hours of sleep and um i didn't allot enough time to go pick up coffee so i ended up with coffee from dunkin donuts with two shots of espresso in it at least they're doing espresso now it helps save it some but i'm admittedly a coffee snob and that was not my favoritest cup of coffee ever so now i know i allot extra time to go get coffee cause i don't drink it often enough to have a supply at home so i have to go procure it elsewhere and i think i'm going to wrap this up now cause this is getting longer than it needs to be and i'm not sure if i can you know assure quality control so yeah if you have a quest leave them i'll try to get to everything in the next one cause i know i've missed some stuff from the previous one and back and forth so i love you all,,1730
720,hello boys and girls and children of all ages i think i did that wrong anyway to the point of the video before i get this whole thing started explaining everything song so forth like i said on my last video no matter video before last i just really want to say one thing i should really start living up to what i say and not just what i do no way what i said in a few videos don't care about your appearance don't try to worry too much i should try to live up to that so i'm going to let you all see my curly hair as it is normal because i figure i might as well before i have it all cut off i'll get to that here in a minute so anyway like i said in my sick blog i have a few things to say one i was sick so i can't i really could not could not get up and do a blog like i would like to second i have a plan i'm going to grow my beard out for the new year i'm going to let it grow out every day i should have recorded it yesterday but i was buh so i'm going to let it grow out now it's growing out as of now you can't tell because it takes time and anyways it will take point is i'm letting this grow out i'm going to grow a full grown beard so on so long so forth weh i'm messing up because i'm still out of it maybe it's the medication that's doing this to me i had an idea pop in my head yesterday ow that hurts i had an idea pop into my head yesterday about what i can do to kind of help out with some new youtubers who are just getting started like um i forgot his name three sixteen maloonics i believe that's your all's name i don't know how many owns this account but i believe they're a partner i can't tell you said you wanted me to give you a shout out um the thing is i don't give shout outs to many people um depending on who they are and if i know them since i've come here to youtube i know quite a few people since i've been here on youtube so they des ser ah deserve a few shout outs which i'm going to start doing here soon see this account was a account a while back so i have a lot of people who enjoy on this account so i'll give them a few shout outs to youtube users who are below my subscription not below i'm sorry i'm off of it a bit today who have less subscribers than me i'm going to give them shout outs because i believe they deserve it well the ones i have subscribed to so i'll start doing that i believe on every friday i'll just look around and take ten new videos take about fifteen minutes of my time if it lasts that long every video and i will probably depending on those videos i will give them a shout out but now i'm not giving shout outs to anyone who has over my sus over more subscribers than me because they are already known apparently unless of course they have friend bops or add bops or just make bank accounts and just add themselves i don't know how it goes i'm not used to this whole cheating or hacking thing i am used to purple combs though i go through these what a month i believe i said that i do one video that's probably it i'm going to start doing that and plus as you can tell it's i'm already looking rather odd with this well technically i don't look odd as of yet because if you all remember i had a goatee a while back and that goatee was annoying and that goatee went away as soon as i had my hair kept along with this beard i'll have a better haircut i hope and i hope i'll be able to straighten it see i don't like my hair curly for some reason i can't stand it it's something wrong with me i have something mentally wrong with me i'm trying to think what gerbert gerbert gerbert gerbert but it doesn't come to mind and i can't think of the word i'm looking for moron moron moron moron but that i think that's probably it and um i'm hoping i can start doing more interesting things that um would not be um boring i guess so some of you all and i hope to get noticed more um what i'm trying to do is think of a video that people may like and they may watch and so forth and therefore it will get views and therefore i will get ratings and therefore i will be a idiot but either way i'm trying to get out there i'm at least trying in my own sense and my own style apparently i can't seem to get the hang of it yet so either way uh this has been blazy alex video of the day a blog day a real video for once not the just stand still image sorry about that again i can't apologize enough and um before i go i'm just happy that a few of my subscribers know about my um let's not my play view channel now blaze outs the gamer apparently they may not know or probably wouldn't want to know until i make a video called and they kind of say hey he's doing let's play not let's placelace screws let's place our uh that's enough of that i'm going to go ahead and close this video out with a have fun with it,,992
721,ooh fire so burn and feed it no that's that was like the only good thing i did throughout the whole game another sexist stereotype only gay guys can be cheerleaders hey okay so i'm going to get straight to the point cause um i don't have time to do my usual intro whatever ha ha rup rup rup rup it's long so now what i was going to say right so the difference between guys and girls what can girls do that guys can't do and what can guys do that girls can't do if that makes sense so first off sexual jokes when a guy says a sexual joke it's gross but hilarious right because that's how guys are they're gross and hilarious but when a girl says a sexual joke it's just gross and depending on how vulgar the sexual joke is it can even make her look like a slut and it sucks too because i know a lot of hilarious sexual jokes but you know i'm just not in the mood to be a ho bag right now another thing um guys have it easy when they need to go to the bathroom and you know what i'm talking about okay so one time my cousin went on a field trip and it was a long bus ride there was no bathroom on the bus and the bus driver didn't want to make a quick stop and his friend who's a guy had to piss so bad he had to piss so bad that his bladder had gas no his bladder didn't really have gas just a metaphor i made up to show you how bad he needed to piss all right so he needed to pee so bad and lucky for him he had an empty water bottle with him yeah this is a little weird and awkward i guess buy hey he did it you know uh a girl can't do that basically guys can just pee anywhere they can pee in the bushes the trees pinecones whatever you know i mean i guess girls can do that too but we don't really like squatting in public maybe for yoga but not huh uh no and then toilet paper you expect us to use a leaf no okay there could be ladybugs one that thing you know roly polies or whatever that's that's yucky what can girls do that guys can't do um we can give birth and go through menustration woo hoo okay so i'm not going too in depth about menustration because i know a lot of guys feel uncomfortable talking about or even hearing the word menustration menustration menustration but you know what suck it up buttercup the words men and straight are in menustration for a reason because you straight men need to suck it up too and that's what she said and uh guys can't give birth either aw shucks yeah guys are never going to know what it feels like to give birth unless they have fallopian tubes or something okay last thing uh sex and stereotypes that stereotype that girls suck at sports or girls can't play football see short guys can be cheerleaders too all right well i gotta go cause it's spring break and i'm supposed to go to a barbecue i can't leave though until i finish my laundry and i have freaking like three baskets of laundry that i need to do and fix my bed and everything and i'm procrastinating i'll right so i guess i'll ttyl,,596

724,hi so you posed the question of which is worse chickens that need chicken tv just to keep themselves from killing each other and hurting themselves or no chickens at all because if we stopped eating chicken that are raised in factory farms they would probably go extinct because there are no more uh chickens that were you know able to live in the wild i think as a vegetarian for the last year and a half and as an animal rights person that while it's a terrible option chickens going extinct is probably better for the chickens because a life lived in captivity and in those horrible conditions is no better than having no life at all and as one of the commenters on your video said a life that doesn't exist can't suffer so as terrible as it sounds to say that i would prefer there be no chickens in the world because chickens are kind of cool um it would be better for the chickens because they would not be suffering in the way that we make them suffer i think that it's great that is person has found a way to lessen to the suffering of chickens in factory farms because they really do suffer horrible horrible tragedies like getting their beaks cut and you know being stuffed in cages where they can't even move and they peck at themselves and each other and there's so much disease and disgusting things going on there but i think the bigger issue is that we put these chickens in those deplorable conditions and we put lots of other animals like pigs and cows and sheep and everything else that we eat just for ourselves in these terrible conditions just so we can feed ourselves in these vastly growing numbers and i think we should try to find alternatives to that so yes in response to your your question i do believe that it would be better for the chickens just to live out their lives without suffering and possibly go extinct because i think that people need to understand the consequences of what we do to the animals in our environment and to our environment itself because as my adorable little sticker says they are not nuggets,,379
725,hi um i guess it's been a while about a month or so since i made my last video but i've done a lot of exciting things and i'm going to tell you what they are i wrote a twelve page paper on bullying i went to niagara falls i saw a play in niagara falls i went to a bird aviary i went to chicago i loved chicago i learned about gangsters gangsters i bought these pink sunglasses went to navy pier i went and saw a stratford festival play i performed in two plays in school i graduated high school got a year book i went to a formal i went to the hospital like a million times for a rare disease called gall bladder disease i got diagnosed with gall bladder disease i have grown blue stones in my stomach i need to get them surgically removed in the next two months yeah i went and i bought lots of books let me just grab them lots of books but i think that the most exciting thing that i've done is buy bulk fortune cookies so i decided that today just for you lucky viewer that i'm going to open a fortune cookie in your honor and it will be your fortune for the rest of your life so your fortune is ooh you will be successful in your work good work you're going to be successful congratulations i really wanted to make this video not shitty because i've been gone for so long but yeah if i ever disappear for like copious amounts of time again i have a twitter that i update all the time and i have a daily boost that i update sometimes i have a blog that i rarely update lately i'm going to try and update it more now that i'm basically done school i'll just take a gander neil's ipod let's see if i can find something good to listen to,,331
726,hey i literally just hung up the phone on my interview for spring twenty ten and i don't know what to think um normally i really love interviewing not love it but i don't mind that part of the process but phone interviewing where you can't see the other person's face is odd it was a weird experience for me so she called like three minutes late i was like sitting on my bed just like staring at my phone from like three twenty exactly um because my interview was at three thirty it lasted exactly half an hour it would have been shorter and because i almost did not get invited to audition which i would have cried we went over my application we talked about some general why do you want to work for disney she said i sounded like i had been a couple of times and what my favorite park was if she had to talk more about my favorites i'd be like well i love magic kingdom but illuminations is my favorite nighttime spectacular and my favorite ride is splash mountain but in epcot it i don't even know what my favorite in epcot is illumination um that's not a ride um and my favorite mgm hollywood studios ride is tower of terror and in evil kingdom i love expedition everest and kilimanjaro safari then we would have talked for like two hours so probably for the best though and we talked she was like what's your favorite resort i was like pioneering because like my dad likes the art club and he is the one paying she's like i see you've retail experience would you like to add quick food service beverage and merchandise i was like i felt bad declining to do either so i was like i guess merchandise would be okay she asked me what my role was she didn't ask me my top three she asked me what i thought i was most qualified for and so i was like attractions and concierge because i compared to the other applicants i don't have the super extensive dance and theatre background i have passion and a bit of a dream i know a lot of people have their dreams but i just it just didn't jump to me as i am qualified to do this i think i am qualified but it was kind of an awkwardly worded question for me i think i qualify for face i don't think i qualify face i'm sorry hi poppy okay no that was scratch that so i said attractions because i love public speaking and concierge because i love guest service and i have a pretty extensive knowledge of walt disney world so we talked about merchandise she asked one question about that she asked a couple about attractions and how comfortable i am on spieling which i am very comfortable as you can tell we talked about concierge quite a bit which was really to me because like i said that's one of my top choices i was pleasantly surprised about how much we spoke about the concierge seeing that i'm not a hospitality user um then she was like do you have any questions for me i was like can i go she was like oh you have to be invited to get the and i was like oh i can totally do this and great i was freaking out that i would not get invited to the utter shine she was like just know it's very competitive i was like i know i know i was like but i was clifford in barnes and noble once and i am getting involved in theatre and please please please invite me so i guess that worked i didn't get to wish her a magical day i kind of wish i had um but on to the audition which i need to rock i don't know guys i am sorry this blog is so long i'm just my heart is still racing i'm oh wow i am hoping for concierge or attractions and i am getting really pumped about spring twenty ten i'm going to be bummed if it doesn't work out bye guys i'm going to euro disney company i'm excited but it's pouring rain again my hair does not like this weather at all hey bye some imagination huh,,738

729,hey there youtube i've just i've had a very rocky week rocky week sorry even i can't talk but um i just want to turn this video on because i want to alert the new at t and iphone customers customers out there about losing your iphone one i don't recommend it two i don't recommend it three i don't recommend it why because you'll be charged up your ass and this is only for like the first year and a half customers here before you get the upgrade so you can get this phone for a cheaper if you get another one on on your same account so let's just let's just take a little story that happened to me this week you all know i went to and somehow the planes just love my ipods and my iphones because each time i leave there i don't come back with them so they just so they just take it away from me so when i got back to my house i i was you know looking over my stuff and seeing what was here and what wasn't and what i had to throw away and i basically noticed i didn't have my iphone with me so i thought maybe i left it in my friend's car so i call him he looks not there now i panic um and that's when i could not find it and that's when i realized that it was gone i did ask my friend to take another good look at it but it's not happening so here i was now without a phone again this is not the first time something bad happened to my iphone by the way never jump into a pool with one um so i'm with another iphone so all right we'll wait until you know around wednesday to get the new phone so i go to the apple store on wednesday and since there is no insurance on the iphone or at least the three g s model um you can you're pretty much going to be paying out of your out of your pocket to get this new iphone so here it is new iphone with a new case in case i'll review it sometime um i'm sure you've heard of all the in cases now but um we go in there and they tell me to do that uh early um step and all that extra stuff that you do before you get a before you get a um new phone so i do that and then i look at the prices four hundred five hundred four ninety nine five ninety nine six ninety nine so the ugs model of course which is the most expensive the one that has the thirty two gigabytes six ninety nine do you understand the numbers six hundred and ninety nine dollars and ninety nine cents for a new iphone if you happen to have the same plan and buy a new iphone what the fuck what the fuck so um yeah so that's when i me and my mom took it through a shit store and um we went out of the store we were looking for the hgv store and near the same area and they told us yeah that's that's the way it is and you almost just lost a customer um now i do cancel my that's when i cancelled my account so i can get the phone cheaper by going to my mom's account now normally i wouldn't do that but you know i needed a phone and i don't want to use what we call a dumb phone a dumb phone is like a normal normal cell phone so i i did everything i could to get a new iphone which i did and um it's very bittersweet so my story here and i'm i'm not blaming apple or at and t um i was at first because you know i was so mad about the price and me losing my phone and it was just a mess but i'm not blaming at t and apple they're gonna run out of business but still to jack up the prices to six ninety nine on the same account are you kidding me and then offer an upgrade about a year and half later that's a little shitty but um but it's not something i don't expect from apple i mean i love apple and everything but you know they have their bad things you know but i so this is just a quick video to tell you to watch out for your iphone cause you don't want to lose this in your first year on a contract with them to break it and maybe go on someone else's plan and get a new phone you don't want that so i advise not to go on another person's plan unless it's a family member that is the only time i will i could say oh yeah cause i did it i'm not going to blame you if you don't do it and now so so that's my story um i did just get odst um i'm friends with the campaign first and i'll accept more invites for friends cause i do want to try out fire fighting so so yeah that's my story guys um work starts next week so videos will probably become a little bit more scarce now i'll try to do a video once in a while i guess it will work out when i'm not at work so i got the life thing and a new car which i'm gonna show and i want to post a new video for you guys i just got a new car it's a mitsubishi lancer gts two thousand and eight so it's a very nice car so um just uh just be weary of losing your iphone and you know all that stuff that happens when you know you lose a phone i mean losing a phone is tough but um but you know i mean lose an i like an iphone type of phone it's gonna be even tougher and at and t and apple don't make it any easier on your first year customer loyalty yeah right now i'm running out of stuff so i'm just

730,when i was thirteen years old i compiled a list of one thousand and sixty three to do when you are bored this notebook holds that list and obviously by watching this video you're guaranteeing yourself a life of no boredom ever forever number one draw a picture of the stupidest thing in the room you're in number two find a cookbook and make the strangest flipping recipe in it number three call your grandma number four go outside and lie in the grass number five name your future kids number six challenge your brother mom grandma or whoever's around to a game of monopoly or a relay race seven read this entire list eight read this entire list again nine keep reading this list until you're so bored that you stopped doing numbers seven through nine on this list number ten take out some pots and pans big spoons and bowls and bang on them number eleven blow bubbles number twelve call someone you haven't talked to in a very long time so i'm getting bored reading this list so i'm gonna skip to um some numbers and interests such as number forty seven which is look up the word dictionary in the dictionary to see if it's there and the best part of number forty seven is that there's a little star that i put there and then if you follow the star to the bottom of the page it says just in case you were dying to know it is five hundred and forty five go on a quest to obtain santa claus autograph so five hundred and forty seven is laugh when your dad seriously believes he strongly resembles george washington i have no recollection of my dad ever believing he seriously resembled um george washington or strongly resembled george washington or in any way resembled george washington yeah so i don't know where i got that from but you guys if you wanna laugh when your dad believes he looks like george washington go for it five hundred and fifty eight count your parents gray hairs this could take a while six hundred and seventy nine make a sculpture of your crush out of play dough seven hundred and twenty six snort seven hundred and thirty six open and close drawers randomly so number seven hundred and fifty four is go trick or treating if it's not halloween and uh it's obviously written in somebody else's handwriting which i think is funny obviously seven hundred and fifty four was not original seven hundred and seventy seven do everything on this list uh number eight hundred and twenty is write a book about scrabble which is very random and strange because i'm very obsessed with scrabble as of now i don't remember every really liking scrabble when i was thirteen so eight hundred and sixty three is make a tossed salad and is toss a tossed salad somewhere pretty brilliant nine hundred and seven say random words in a random order in a way that people think you are saying something really philosophical and then i wrote or whatever that word is but you were really just saying random words in a random order number nine hundred and seventeen glue two paper plates together tell people it is a spaceship and count the weird looks take pictures of the people that believe you cause that is kinda weird cool or sad i can't decide nine hundred and forty one tape your face and i put a little star after face and if you follow the star down it says okay not your face literally but a picture or something anyway tape your face on a one dollar bill because you rule nine hundred and seventy eight make a happy list type up a bunch of stuff that makes you happy give it a pretty border print it out and put it somewhere where you will see it a lot and remember don't worry be happy one thousand and sixteen go to an art gallery and tell people that you appreciate good art they probably won't care but it is something to do one thousand twenty six walk around your block wearing something kinda weird like a bathing suit boots and a bathrobe see if anyone notices,,720
731,what's up internet here so many of you will have switched to summer time last night and if you're anything like me then you'll always spend a little moment thinking ooh do i change the clock from two to three or back from three to two and there's an interesting little phrase to help you remember that and that's in spring spring forward and in fall fall back and that always helps to remember you know when you lose an hour and when you gain an hour although i still haven't really figured out the use of summertime whatever and such a little trick is called a mnemonic or however you pronounce it m and an n in a row i don't know who thought of that there are actually a number of these tricks floating around you know helping you remember stuff and i find them very useful because i am lazy that way for example one of those tricks is you know when you screw in a screw um which way do you turn and uh there's a trick lefty loosey righty tighty so if you look at the top of a screwdriver turning it to the right will tighten the screw and turning it to the left will loosen the screw that's pretty practical if you're ever in a ship or a boat you'll know that there's no left and right there's always portside and starboard side right but which one is which here's another interesting mnemonic phrase to help you out with port is always left at sea but never at dinner you know pertaining to port wine so if you're facing the front of the boat port is left side starboard is the right side here's another one that i like when you set up a chess board right do you set it up this way or that way and you actually set it up this way why because white is right got it there also used to be this nice phrase to help you remember you know the planets in the solar system as seen from the sun and that used to be my very excellent mother just served us nine pizzas you know with each first letter of a word pertaining to the first letter of a planet you know mercury venus earth and so on and so forth of course back when i was in school pluto was still a planet and i am really starting to show my age there you know when i was your age sonny the solar system actually had one more planet than it does now well anyway so i don't know if there is a new mnemonic phrase for that maybe like my very excellent mother just served us nothing i don't know um yeah but you know things like that happen and help in real life you know i'm not even going to go into all the details of my private phrases like you know stalactites whatever but if you have any mnemonic phrases that you'd like to share with the rest of us please do thanks a lot bye bye,,526
732,hey it's friday and as you can see behind me it is definitely winter it's so cold but considering the theme i felt it was appropriate to tape outside i wouldn't exactly call myself team winter because i can't really pick a favorite season but i do like winter and i'm glad it's not like this year round but i have fun when it comes you know just for a few months and stuff because you know it's kinda fun even though it's freezing and also i'm a pretty big fan of christmas music and christmas in general and ice skating and christmas movies and christmas and it's also fun to go sledding with my friends and i can't think of a better way to spend an evening than reading by a fireplace when you can see like snow outside and it's just like super toasty in the house but it's like mmm the best oh and hot chocolate hot chocolate hot chocolate i'm not really sure what else to talk about when it comes to winter but i thought maybe favorite christmas movies might be a good topic of conversation and i think you girls should answer this question too in maybe your videos next week or something just tell us what some of your favorite christmas movies are and commentors sic you should leave me comments and tell me what some of your favorite christmas movies are some of mine are oh hello hee hee hee my dad came outside because i'm taping this later in the day after i got back from work instead of taping it in the morning like i usually do oops my favorite christmas movies are i really like while you were sleeping i love it's a wonderful life i really like the muppet christmas carol because it's awesome and it has awesome songs in it and i get them stuck in my head and it's fantastic and a christmas story and elf elf so funny best christmas movie ever except not really the best one ever because i like a lot of christmas movies but it's one of my favorites it's good i really can't think of anything else to talk about and it is cold out here so i think that i'm just going to make this video really short so sorry if it's really really short and megan i'll see you on monday stay sweet,,405
733,i'm here to talk about a very special organization called the crohn's and colitis foundation of america this is especially important to me for one important reason i have ulcerative colitis and i'm gonna talk to you about it this is me this is of the and i have one thing in common we both have ulcerative colitis hank and i are completely different people we live in different states we're different ages and we live completely different lives but we do have one thing in common we both have ulcerative colitis i've had it since i was fourteen hank's had it since he was twenty three ulcerative colitis is not a fun disease there is very little you can do about it except for medicate lots of medication pills pills pills pills tic taks so the crohn's and colitis foundation of america or the ccfa works to help aid research into finding a cure for ulcerative colitis or crohn's disease as of right now the only real solution to crohn's or colitis is something called an ileectomy an ileectomy's a procedure where they take out the diseased part of the colon the only problem with that is it's not always successful don't get me wrong it's not a bad procedure i have a friend who had crohn's disease then he had an ileectomy and now lives a completely normal life in fact he's getting married tonight the problem is the people who it doesn't work for sometimes they never get back to normal and their bodies are completely different for the rest of their lives and it's pretty bad so let's get back on topic the ccfa i'm supporting it because it's important to me this is a foundation that can make a massive difference for millions and millions of people around the world who have live with daily pain from ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease like hank and i okay now if you have no i every year for the past three thousands and thousands of people have been making project for awesome videos a project for awesome video is a video where you choose a charity and you make a video supporting it then you go and you find other project for awesome videos you rate it you comment it and you favorite it until you your fingers fall off hopefully by doing this we can trick youtube's algorithm so the main pages are just project for awesome videos at the end of the project for awesome the top promoted charities get tons and tons of money donated to them so in the end for one day youtube's not about cats jumping in and out of boxes or about kanye being a jerk it's about raising money for charity and making the world suck a little less so rate comment and favorite this video and other project for awesome videos and try to make a difference by the way hank's on my wall i have a complicated relationship with the distal portion of my large intestine also known as the colon i started feeling kinda shitty when i turned twenty three and then the pain got worse and worse every day and the days turned into weeks i finally went to see the doctor and i pooped into a cup and then a few weeks after that he stuck this camera up my butt and the camera was in a tube and the tube it pumped out air so that my colon would inflate and they could look around in there when i woke up the doctor was looking at my chart i called his attention to me with a fifteen minute fart and he said son i hate to tell you cause i know you're not gonna like this but they got a name for what you have and it's called ulcerative colitis and in those seven syllables there's a mess of shitty news it's likely that you've had your last healthy feeling poos it's like road rash on your colon you'll bleed it'll hurt and no one knows what causes it and there is no cure and yeah your chances of cancer have gone up a bit but colon cancer's curable if you keep your eye on it but what's mostly what will piss you off is how much you're gonna pay i know you're not insured and you'll probably stay that way see insurance companies hate to deal with sick folks like you they don't like taking money from folks they might have to give it back to and your pills are gonna cost you both your arms and at least one leg i suggest you go to canada get on your knees and beg because here the costs are as high as the market conveyer take a barrel and compare it with soiled underwear i sat there on that bed and thought about how i used to like to pooh i thought that maybe there was a mistake how could this be true i asked the doctor pleading begging if he was sure and if he was how could it be that there was no cure the only cure we have he said is to take the whole thing out and then to get your movements out we install a little spout i told him that i'd rather take a thousand thousand dollar pills he agreed and sent me home with similar sounding bills and now really all i've learned besides the importance of fiber is the health care system's more screwed up than a fifty year old fred subscriber,,937

740,hey youtubers so i just experienced something i thought was pretty scary i just got back from my classes and i just experienced some of the scariest walks to class and from class it is icy outside the streets are slick with ice and so are the sidewalks and i had a class today one class today one one class at twelve thirty so i left my apartment at about eleven fifty i got over there at about twelve fifteen that's how long it took me to get from here my apartment all the way to the campus and it was scary because i was trying not to fall down the entire time there was a couple of times i almost fell but thankfully i lowered myself to the ground so i didn't fall too badly the reason why i don't want to fall again is because i already fell about two weeks ago i guess now and i skinned my knee and it hurt and i didn't want to repeat that again especially with ice because that's really cold so it was really scary because i was walking and i had slipped and i was sliding and it was really scary and you might think i am being overly dramatic about this but i'm not i'm from a place where it normally doesn't get all that icy and here it's really icy they closed the campus at two o'clock and took a long time just to get back got back and i had a message on my phone it's from work they are closing the public library down at five o'clock due to the weather which is when i would normally go in to work thank goodness for that because i don't know how i would have made it to work i was gonna have to call in and say i could not because there is no way i was going to go anywhere so i'm guessing the city is closing down a lot of things looked like they were closing down everybody is being sent home campus is shut down so yeah it's pretty scary out there now why am i telling you this because i have nothing else to do i am pretty much going to be locked up for the rest of the night and as far as i know right now i don't know if i'm going to have classes tomorrow or not i'm hoping not because it's supposed to be really bad tonight i'm hoping that tomorrow they'll say no don't come to class and then the library will still be closed and then i'll be another day stuck inside here but that gives me an opportunity to catch up with school work which i need to do because i haven't done it yet that's all i really had to say just freaking out about the ice and i'm going to go get me some lunch now and eat and then just i'm here for the rest of the night so that's all youtube,,510

742,hello hello youtube long time no see huh um so i just wanted to say hello to you guys and give a kind of like a little update and everything i just want to say i have not forgotten about all of you just kind of took a break a break since august i guess i think that is the last time i made an update weight loss video so i just wanted to say i have not forgotten about you i still check this youtube channel pretty often and i'm still following a lot of you guys on your weight loss journeys and yeah i mean i kind of have just been a way for a while school kind of consumes my life when i get started with it i really hoped to continue make videos throughout the school year but that just wasn't a possibility i was just so so wrapped up in school this year but i'm finally done so that is super exciting um so the end of april which is about the same time that i started last year with the whole weight loss thing so hopefully like you know a year later you can kind of get back on the bandwagon and everything else um that's not to say that i've fell off the bandwagon exactly you know last year around this time you know i weighed about probably close to two hundred pounds or something like that and i started on a weight loss program and i lost close to about fifty pounds i would say and i've kept basically all of that off right now i'm weighing approximately like one hundred sixty one pounds so that's basically what i weighed in august i think that i was around one let's see what did i weigh um i dunno it was something like that it's on my main channel page but i've basically stayed the same i haven't gained i haven't really lost i mean i guess you can look at that as a little small victory woohoo but yeah i don't really have much today just to say i haven't really gained i haven't really lost yeah so i've been doing good i've not really been watching what i've been eating i do occasionally go and walk at a park near my house so but that's not really a whole lot of exercise i think a lot of you you know i kind of feel guilty because i feel like some of you that if you don't watch what you eat every second of the day or if you don't get in your thirty minutes of exercise you know you'll gain a pound within like a day and i've just been very blessed with being able to maintain my weight even when i'm not really trying and um i just have to make sure that i don't abuse that and turn that into oh i can eat whatever i want because i mean obviously i can't you know i can't go out and pig out and eat ice cream and pizza and have a little birthday party diet what me and my friends like to call it eating like it's your birthday every week but um yeah i can't do that you know i still have to try and get a balanced healthy diet with salad lean meat um you know i don't drink any regular soda if i am gonna drink soda i drink diet i try to drink water or i get those crystal lite packets and i you know it looks gross like pee or something but it's just the lemonade flavor crystal lite and you know it's all about moderation if you want to have you know the bowl of ice cream eat the bowl of ice cream but the next day maybe have a bowl of fruit for dessert i mean i dunno i don't always follow that advice i'm a very good advice giver i just don't normally follow it but that's kind of just the things you have to do to try and maintain your weight you can't just go nuts and it's all about self control so it's kind of like my little tip of the day hopefully i can start making videos again because i am done with school for the year um i'm about to go out of town for the next two weeks my boyfriend is graduating so i'm about to go and visit him and watch his graduation that's next week and then two weeks after that or a week after that or something i'm going on a road trip with one of my good friends so that will be fun but after that hopefully i can kind of start making videos more regularly again um see i dunno there not like a whole lot to say in terms of progress like again i haven't really gained or lost i keep saying that i'm sure your like i know i get it now okay gee um but yeah so just know that i haven't forgotten about you guys and for all the new subscribers that i've gotten thank you so much i'm sure your like watch my videos and like okay this girl is cool you know i can watch her and then i kind of did nothing or anything so your probably like what the heck come on so um but no kind of my hopefully my little will come back hopefully um yeah so i guess be looking out for some new videos i kind of have a few things planned so yeah i guess i will talk to you guys later bye,,955

744,do you remember your first computer so i was writing this paper for my consumerism class on that kind of topic and it got me thinking our parents tell us stories about remembering getting their first television or switching from black and white to color and our grandparents still reminisce about the radio but we are the generation who when we have our own kids are gonna be saying things like my first computer only had five hundred twelve megabytes of ram and i had to walk two miles in the snow uphill both ways just to get to frye's to get my floppy disc i was eight when my family got our first computer i was busy playing outside when my dad was hooking it up i remember him sitting me down and saying this is a very big day that you're going to remember for the rest of your life i also remember looking at him at this point saying cool then asking if i could go back outside so i could play on my swing set which was at the time incredibly superior in fun levels to this boring computer my parents were trying to get me to play with about a year later i had my first experience with the internet i was in elementary school and my classroom had one computer that they had at the back of the room and there's this one day that they let every single person in my class have fifteen minutes to go surf the web during my turn i just sat down and stared at the screen for a minute before turning to the person who's supervising us and saying so what do i do she told me to check out a website to search for something that i like i remember that i typed in hanson went to some weird hanson fan site looked around for five minutes and got bored and then gave up the rest of my turn to someone else a lot's changed since then so basically i was wondering what your first experiences were with the computer or with the internet were you old enough to remember it were you super excited about it or did you just not care like me i mean granted this was a very long time ago also if you want to see the latest adventures in the apartment rent series then you can check out the link to the mosbeys in video in the sidebar thing seriously our family's first computer in order for me to play my baby sitters club game my dad had to actually uninstall my brother's tonka truck game because we only had enough hard drive space to have one game installed at a time those were the days okay that's all for now see ya also if you want to see what's ha ha i had to uninstall the apartment rent story argh,,491

747,hey nerd piteria right now you're probably wondering why is this girl dressed up like harry potter well that's for a really good reason the charity i'm supporting today in my project for awesome video has really changed my life and so it's harry potter so let's get to it in the summer of two thousand and eight i was diagnosed with a mild form of epilepsy which meant my arms would shake when i would wake up in the morning sometimes and they would consider this a seizure then in january of two thousand and nine i had my first grand seizure in which my whole body seized up and i ended up hitting my head before blacking out um this is an experience that changed my life and really freaked me out the charity that i'm supporting this year is the epilepsy foundation um for a couple of reasons first they use all their money for a lot of research and ways to prevent and treat epilepsy and make life for those who are epileptic better and also because um after i had my grand mall seizure i was able to go on there and talk to people who have um had grand mall seizures before and talk about them and relate to them because there's nobody um for me to talk to in real life about what i was going through it's really a great organization and one that's really close to my heart and it would mean a lot to me if could help it out this year um so yeah dftba,,266
748,like that yeah so what have i been up to converted to pastafarianism got a partner who lost the ability to sleep at night got a shamwow got a partner got all of my traveling plans for canada and peru cancelled my partner found out that i actually needed to get a job did i mention that i have a partner yeah i did i got a partner um if you noticed the the banner on my page right now is uh justin and that would be boldy a very good friend of mine and this month is actually boldy appreciation month when a bunch of us are appreciating boldy and giving him as much attention on youtube as we can because he deserved it and he's awesome i also developed a real unhealthy photoshopping obsession here's some examples of people i've been destroying i'm gonna be again this is horrible i have two orientations coming up um and they were i've been to my campus like a few times lost every single time i don't i have such a know where i'm going hi youtube i'm kind of squished in here right now but that's not important what is important is that i'm actually making a blog but in this blog i'm going to be talking a lot an awful lot about myself i know i don't know if you would call it an update but it's your call so in order to make it bearable for both of us i'm going to insert clips of my dog because he's adorable okay bye,,264
749,darwin influenced freud a lot which is true he did um he was a big influence on freud's work um and he darwin also believed you know the survival of the fittest and you know um the primal urge of you know back way back in caveman kinda sticks with us and um my professor was basically saying that sexual attraction is evolutionary as well and that you know men are attracted to really skinny girls with a certain hip to waist ratio um because you know that's their primal instinct their primal urge they wanna be with those girls because they're gonna be the healthiest and they're gonna last the longest and blah blah blah for mating ritual things and that like girls are attracted to really muscular guys because um they'll take care of them and survive the longest um first of all that my battery is dying shit hold on okay don't mind the dirty laundry behind me that you know it's primal instinct because guys who are muscular are going to take care of them more and survive the best and be able to fight off those saber tooth tigers et cetera well and you know it's a good theory um however i find a lot of flaws in it um first off the flaws i find are that a if a guy was going to be attracted to the girl who was going to last the longest like live the longest and be able to bear him children i don't think he would be attracted to the really skinny girls i mean i i have nothing against really skinny girls um i have friends who are really skinny but i think that you know as far as bearing children they wouldn't they want someone with a little bit more meat and hip and being able to you know bear that child and also as far as live the longest back then like way way way way back in history fatter i mean they didn't have all the signs of cardio problems and stuff so fatter seemed healthier because you weren't starving you weren't sickly you weren't going to you know just die from starvation or you know be able to be freezing in the winter you'd have more meat on you to keep you warm so i find a flaw in that because i don't think that that would be you know the case and also i think it's kind of sexist in a way because who says that girls have to be attracted to the muscular guys to take care of them um i mean i was perfectly fine without a guy i don't need a guy to take care of me um i chose the guy i love because i love him and we're good companions and we take care of each other so i don't need some muscular guy to ward off saber toothed tigers no give me arabia and i'll fence off the saber toothed tiger i fence well i used to but i want to continue so i mean seriously i just think that it's ridiculous personally and i think attraction as far as mass attraction like what we're told to think is attractive is fed to us by the media by tv shows music posters um yeah it's just fed to us and we're told what is socially acceptable from early on even like little kids when you tell them bed time stories the beautiful princess was thin tall long blond hair golden hair and blue eyes be passionate and hyped up about this because like seriously it is just fed to us through society not just the media but society in general and our culture in the united states and the world today because of mass communications and just everything story books disney movies you know everything tells us to like a certain type of person true beauty and true love and attraction is just in the eye of the beholder i've never liked muscular men i've always thought muscles were kinda gross i mean not like normal muscles but i mean like the big muscles six packs you know like the ripped guys i always thought that just looked unnatural and just gross there are also a lot of guys who are attracted to bbw's and are kind of in the closet about it and also back to the primal instinct thing if it was solely attraction on primal urge of mating rituals then why are there so many people who are homosexual that is just like love and attraction that is not you know a primal urge um so yeah it's not just a primal mating ritual okay so i believe in soulmates and i believe in reincarnation and i believe we have many lives so i believe that people that we are attracted to it's because we are attracted to their soul because either we knew them in another life or we knew them in heaven or we wanted to know them so i think it's just a beautiful and romantic thing that we're connected to certain people um and it's more in depth um i also think that's why we're connected to certain animals more like certain pets because maybe we knew them in another life maybe they were human before um i just i don't know i have a very pollyanna view on the world so i've been told i don't know maybe you shouldn't listen to me but i'm a very hopeless romantic philosophical everything is fantasy and beauty and whatever but that's just how i am and it's just what i believe um i'm not really scientific but it's just a feeling that's inside me you know but um yeah and another thing i noticed is erm a lot of people are attracted to people of the same body type i know at least it's from it's that way for me i've dated a couple of really skinny guys and i never liked dating guys who are skinnier or smaller than me that always made me feel so huge and it just it made me feel very uncomfortable and it was just my own self esteem issue so when looking for a guy i would look for a guy who was the same a little smaller or bigger than me but not really skinny because i just i would feel really like a giant if i was around a really skinny guy and no girl wants to feel like that but again that's also a societal thing girls can't be bigger than their guys another society pushed thing so yeah i think attraction sexual attraction is you know on a whole in the eye of the beholder and everybody finds someone else attractive and also it's also society what they push you to find attractive and what you grow up learning is attractive but one of my favorite quotes is i don't love you because i think you're attractive i think you're attractive because i love you and it's so true my husband will always be attractive to me because i love him and i'm sure it's on the other end at least he's told me that so i'll leave you with that quote thanks bye happy monday,,1227
750,not turned on not turned on hi guys it's been a while since i made a video and i want to make a video with a general update and to i went to last week it was awesome uh it was an epic concert they really put on the show it was really amazing on december fifth we had a celebration uh sin sinta claus it's called similar to san santa claus but we also do uh do presents under the christmas tree but we don't uh the children here don't believe in santa claus they believe in sinta claus i got some cool presents i will show you in the dvd update i'm gonna do um it was awesome so i didn't come to do no more videos so because and in the situation and that is um i told you i got a job i love my job and yeah if people tell you a story why they lose their job and what's the story the it's not their fault you're always thinking yeah but what is the story of the other of the other side from the people who fired them what's the real reason someone someone who is fired always tells they're not at fault they're uh or they don't tell the whole story yeah but i am certainly one of the guys who yeah definitely gonna tell the story straight how how how it went um media uh minimarts i work at stern uh i explained that in the other video and they're the same as the mediamarket and the mediamarket is more known as they're all around the world so some people may know may know it some people not this is like it's like a big a big entertainment store and they sell tvs cds dvds video games uh washing machines you call it and saturn is the same as that basically the same company only they're smaller and they hired me two months ago uh for uh uh for to do sales only on the cd dvd video games and most times when you try to sell something it's on the section from the dvd game uh the video games wednesday they invited me to have a talk because uh my period yeah my period this sounds very wrong uh my my trial period at their store almost expended and i went i went uh yeah to be exactly yesterday but i went to brussels uh this weekend um for the christmas but so they invited me for a talk and they said uh yeah after this period uh we have to do a lot of yeah uh they have to send back a lot of cds dvds they have to get things out of the shop uh because of the store and send them back to the uh to the distribution company or someone else all of this administration work and they they said i wouldn't uh yeah um i wouldn't yeah do that or we'll not could not handle that or something like that at the time yeah i should have been sharper and said why you think that why do you think i can't handle that but i was so overwhelmed by more like what the hell's happening um and that was just a bullshit reason because um they could check how much i was i sold a lot i was every day almost every day i was a top uh top salesman from all the stuff in the store i was number three or number two once num number one because i did i i i did i sold very well i did i was a very good salesman on the floor so it wasn't a reason yeah to get me fired but then uh yeah i was really someone who first or last of all think what the hell's happening and afterwards i really can get pissed i'd use a line the one like this i'm really wishing the worst of people who are responsible for getting me get getting me fired i think why why would you do something why let someone quit his uh part time job and then in the same at the station uh oh fu how do you say that that was a period trial period over it's moved over and you get a contract for half a year that's really pissed me off i really feel like slapping or punching someone in the face i don't i don't i i do now that it doesn't help but it feels good to to make them yeah feel what i feel okay this sounded like like a little bit sorry it's just uh rage and it's more talk than yeah i'd actually something do really something but i'm not going to i just feel better it was a temporary job how i hope i've hooked this contract for six months and find something else that fits my education uh because i don't do i didn't yeah i did i started with a low education in middle school and worked to uh yeah do college for study for for construction with that there's a middle nbo called external for that kind of qualification and then do a high uh higher education that's just a step below university it's called hbo by the way that's uh very funny but um when you finish you don't that you find a job that fits your study and yeah pays more than what i do now this job what i did pay money and i had something to do this job didn't pay much but i learned how to sell something how to communicate with people i can barely i was really friendly to customers i really could help them get on their level and so it did help them with the good sales this they disrespect me so much there um also the reason i think i realize now first that it was it made any sense they had training to sell to train you to train your sale to train you into make better sales and they told me first uh day they forgot to plan me uh in for the courses for the training and now it makes sense because if you hire someone who you uh who you who you kick away after a struggle why put him on courses it's only a waste of money so that's probably the reason why i they forgot to to to put me on the training so yeah so i know help you have to be the better one and eh this this is not my work but i i didn't do this but this is my brother's work i ripped out the buttons and that is a small work shirt and my brother made it knots in it and it's very really tight and i have to deliver them back when you've worked there up to two months you get twenty percent off the price uh so i asked i wanted to get screened there and it wasn't they didn't the delivery have to come in and then first going to get but that with twenty percent off the price and then i come to deliver the keys back that's all yeah i had the paper they had to sign the paper and you contract a day when you don't give them back or something like that you have to pay fifty euro or so but i am not going to she saw i had first gone to buy the screen and then i going to deliver these forms back it's really childish but i had to put on my rates on something and i my rent so yeah i don't got a job now i don't want to go back to my job where i worked and do that full time i thought i hate it when it's part time but this is the only place where i got certainty to go back to for now and but i don't want to it's five days in a week and it with i really hate it and i don't want to go there so okay had a um also i want to say on twenty six november on november of twenty six um i went um i was a year on youtube with this channel um got um almost three years on youtube with my other channel but i wanted to a video that day but then i had to work and i didn't have many time so um my year on youtube i really love it and met a lot of nice people with cool channels uh it was really cool a very very cool community and i am very happy here i hope i reach the four hundred subscribers before i uh i hit the full year so its nice number but yeah sounds about the subscribers but but it

753,socializing is somewhat of a difficult task for me you may be asking yourself what is so difficult about socializing would it be the awkward silence in between series of questions nope or maybe it's the fact that you state one of your interests as collecting dictionaries what no oh look an italian dictionary um bi net oo toilet or perhaps it's awkward that you tell people you write blog skits for youtube why did i write that in there socializing is awkward simply because i have to state my name yup that's it and scenarios like this have rolled around roll it hi hello my name is tina what's your name my name is what maybeen may may been maydon maaayyyyy you know what i lied my name's bob oh bob nice to meet you yep that's my name usually it's used for boys but i'm special you know very special or maybe something like this would roll around hey my name is hi i'm ann two weeks later hey ann hi michelle it's become so bad that i don't pronounce my name in french anymore because people can't seem to grasp it so i'm wondering do you have scenarios like this leave a text comment below or give me a video response bye bye thanks for watching keep nerding it up nerrrrrrrrrrrrr,,224

756,i'm going to ask a question don't expect an answer because nobody really ever answers any of my questions in these stupid things anyways ah i read the story today about the ah ah four or five guantanamo um uh detainees that have openly um admitted to planning and setting into motion the um um september th attacks on the world trade center and in the statement that they released it essentially from the way it's told they bra were bragging about the fact that they that it was so successful um they were very proud of how successful it was and how it was a gift from them to god um the confusion i get is that this is no surprise to me i mean the fact that it's a surprise to anyone is is more of a surprise to me than these particular detainees saying that i mean especially considering they honestly believe their religion and their god is telling them or maybe not so much literally telling them but dictates that they are supposed to do these things that their religion dictates that they're supposed to um punish the infidels which they consider non muslims to be um they're extremists that's kind of the thing you know extremists do extreme things based on their religious beliefs it's not a big surprise but it seems like it's being portrayed as a horrible awful ruthless evil thing that these people are bragging about it the people um extremists of every religion do some freaky ass shit christians did it muslims do it i mean don't know enough about jews to know if they did do it um buddhists follow buddha i mean starts off being scrawny and skinny keeping themselves from eating and then turns into ah you need to eat eat eat eat and enjoy everything about life fat buddha bald buddha every extremist in every religion does some weird shit um i'm not excusing um i i personally do not believe that it is right to uh to cause harm or to hurt anyone who has at best a vague connection to the government or military which you think you're having a war with and this is where my confusion comes in um i don't understand how i can understand the point of view of the terrorists don't agree with of the even the extreme groups such as the taliban and some of the insurgent groups and why i can understand some of their motivation some of the reasoning behind it and i'm sure if i you know went and just researched it more probably interviewed people or whatnot like that that are involved in these particular situations i would understand their motivation a lot more it doesn't mean i would agree with their their actions um it just means i would understand why it's sort of like ah you have a weird brother or sister for some strange reason whenever they get into a car ah they start picking their nose um i'm pretty sure you could probably find why they do that ah ah it's the same thing you can find out the reason for everything you might not agree with the action but you can understand and find out why did this happen or why did they do this but nobody it seems in the united states is attempting in any way shape or form to do that i mean we also see how big a failing that is one of the biggest problems that we've seen in the middle east throughout history is the lack of trying to find out the lack of concern of understanding why or the motivations of middle eastern people great britain when it had ah much of the middle east as it's colonies um as as under its protection its control as colonies they failed because they didn't understand or even bother to understand ah the russians ah huge war in i think it's either iran or afghanistan one of those two countries they failed because they didn't bother to try to understand and um sadly enough and a lot of people will get pissed about this the united states was failing in iraq for the same reason we refused to or just didn't have the ability to understand or even try to figure it out ah um the whys and the the um the motivations and actually we currently are being so successful not because of military might but from all reports it's back room deals um discovering motivation and giving them other motivation ah making connections that we didn't make before non military things and yes there are some black offs that go on too but it's it's more based on intelligence and and understanding and discovering the answers the motivation to things then it was military might military might got us nowhere military might got great britain nowhere military might got russia nowhere i mean it has gotten no one when it come to the middle east anywhere but for some strange reason in the united states all we can think of or whenever it comes to terrorists or anybody associated with terrorism or anybody associated with um september eleventh and those attacks and what went on like that um what we should do is we should do anything that we can to get them to confess to having something to do with any of those certain things just to keep us safe and not lock them in the legal rights that we have um that we should in any shape or form try to understand any of this to maybe find a way of not of preventing something like this from happening again instead it's they're evil they're awful you know these are disgusting horrible horrible evil people that need to be just blown off the face of the planet um it's not going to work and i just don't understand why why so many people refuse to even attempt to understand i mean it's like if you try to understand a person's motivation that's done something so horrible as killed three thousand people it's like you're siding with them it's like you're trying to excuse it ah i mean that's the way people treat me whenever i ask them you know they're not evil they're just stupid misguided wrong you know it's the act that they did from our point of view is evil but they're not evil they're doing what they think is right but nobody will everyone is convinced that i have spoken to or asked about this that i'm wrong i mean that in saying those things i'm saying what they did was excusable and i personally don't think that killing anyone is excusable but in any case it comes down to my question um which like i said nobody ever really watches these damn things and if they do they don't actually answer my questions um my question is this the five or four guantanamo bay detainees that have taken um taken responsibility for the ah ah september eleventh attacks of the world trade centers and bragged about it and said it was a gift ah ah to god um they did this believing that their religion their god is wants them to do it that this is what they are um supposed to do this is what they are compelled to do based on their religion and i'm not saying that they're right and their analysis of their religion i mean and there will be a lot of conceptions of any one religion but that's what they believe they believe that they are compelled to they are required to by their god by their religion to perform these acts whether we find them horrible or not i mean they feel they have to do them that this is part of their belief system um so back to my question the thing is whatever religion you happen to be if theoretically your god whoever you happen to worship showed up right in front of you just showed up and told you um or rather asked you to go and uh strap a bunch of c four to your waist and blow up everybody who's visiting the lincoln memorial monument and um and in asking why your god told you because there are people there that are evil and they need to be destroyed so i need you to go and destroy these people and if you don't do this then these evil people will continue to do some terrible horrible things that will cause the death of children and women and innocent people innocent people that you care about would you go and do it and then if you did that would you be evil for doing it because i hate to say this but a lot of these extremists muslim extremists that are performing these terroristic acts believe their religion and god is compelling them to do this is asking them or demanding that they do these things these acts that your god asked you or demanded or whatever your religious beliefs happen to be for you to do how would that make you any different than the terrorist i mean now we're saying literally your god is asking or demanding that you do this and that if you don't these evil people are going to cause harm to people that you care about how if you did it would it be different than them doing it when them,,1601
757,hey everyone i haven't made a blog in a while so i just thought i would update you all on a few things what was the last thing we talked about it's been a couple weeks it's been a few weeks since i made a blog but um here's what's going on at my job as many of you know i got taken off of my route job and i got put into the shop i'm kinda back out on the route now but i'm training a new guy and here's why i trained a guy before he was out on the route he was doing a good job he started slacking off he started getting an attitude he smarted off to the boss he started looking kinda sloppy not shaving not tucking his shirt in not wearing a belt told the boss that they didn't pay him enough for him to shave and tuck his shirt in which is kinda bullshit and after that he just it just seemed like he stopped caring then he went off on me in front of the boss they fired his ass so now i'm training a new guy also this guy that they fired he told the boss that i threatened to kill him which is bullshit because i didn't i've been training this new guy since friday last friday and uh he's doing pretty good i'll probably be out with him for a few weeks and then i getting my job back in the shop and i'm this is moving up and down cause i got my laptop on my lap or will you just have to bounce with me my wife and i ordered a new christmas present for the both of us uh we've never had a nintendo wii so there was a special uh what's it called that cyber monday sale thing and we ordered a nintendo wii with all kinds of extra stuff and we should be getting it soon ordered a few games got our christmas shopping done with well almost and there was something else i wanted to talk about but i forgot what it was it was cold and rainy outside today huh uh my back hurts what's new uh my laptop it kinda took a shit on itself my old laptop ah my wife tried to take it to the it tech at her work and have him look at it and he couldn't fix it she brought it back home and i fixed it so i gave it to her so she got a perfectly fine laptop for free uh youtube rap music video i've got the track i got all that done the music's done now i've gotta put the video together i've started putting bits and pieces together but i still gotta record my part but uh i still want you all's clips if you all wanna send me any clip a lot of you all might've taken that video the wrong way where i said send me any clips i've had a couple people say can i send you anything can i can i send you some music no it's a music video it's my music my lyrics my song i'm singing it and i just want clips of you like random clips of you blogging to talking to the camera doing driving blogs uh anything from your previous videos which is simply short like looking at the camera crossing your eyes or sticking your tongue out just anywhere from like two to five seconds long cause i'm gonna have random clips like shoot across the screen or something like that whatever but um so something simple like that and if you're lucky i might throw on another preview on the at the end of this video like just a little short clip of the song the finished song if you're lucky now we're just gonna be cheesy uh you know i can't think of anything else to talk about right now what i was gonna talk about there was something else i wanted to talk about but i can't remember and i'll probably remember as soon i finish editing this video and get it ready to upload i'll probably remember then if i do i'll just write it over in the description sample or i'll make another video tomorrow but uh yeah that's it for now i'm gonna try to start blogging a little more but i just haven't haven't really felt like it lately i haven't i just haven't had just haven't felt like blogging i haven't really had much to talk about but uh i guess that is it for now and i'll talk to you all later this video goes out to all my payers immature small penis wanna be dictators if you don't like my cheesy ass rap song you can just go suck a dick all day long just think of youtube it's been so much fun if i've never found the internet what would i've done what i've done if i've never found the internet i'd probably be sitting here staring at the tv set i would've never been or called a newb i would've never found this community on youtube what i've done if i've never found the internet i'd probably sitting here staring at the tv set,,897
758,so christina asked us to talk about our first computer basically my dad has had a computer in our house my whole life and my parents would use it for like writing their sermons and stuff so it made sense for them to have one and my earliest use of the computer was to play games like the aladdin computer game i remember i had a lot of fun with that one there was another one the toy story computer game and i remember having um where in the world is carmen san diego the computer game when we lived in minnesota my neighbors had the indian jones atlantis game i remember playing that i loved that game and then they also had a game that was put together similarly but it was a game about these tentacles that took over the world how you got to actually travel forward and backward in time to like save the world from the tentacles in elementary school i remember we got like computer time like our computer class every like week we would play weird games likes um the name of the game was thinking things i remember that had thinking things one thinking things two thinking things three and like you got to play like different games within it and i remember there was like reading rabbit from like when we were learning how to read and like different games like that i just found it was like really fun stuff i remember when we first got the internet i think i was like eight years old when we got the internet yeah i remember it would take like a day for the email to get from your computer to their computer so it was just weird and i would say definitely a lot has changed since i got my first computer although it's still the mac it's still the mac it's a much better mac,,325
759,hey this is gonna be my second video blog and i figured since i skipped out on introductions on the first one and immediately started complaining about my dorm mates i should let you all know a little bit about myself um as i said in my first blog my name is like music there is an interesting story behind that my father is a musician my mother is tacky they thought it would be good to name me it's a nice name so i can't complain and it rhymed anyways um i'm a freshman in college i won't tell you which college i'm going to for the sake of privacy but i am a freshman planning to graduate in two thousand and twelve um my major is art with the focus on illustration i drew this it's pretty isn't it and i am obsessed with reading the internet video games even though i suck at them and arty stuff in general and i am eighteen and taken so bad and i think that's about it now that would be a really short blog so i guess i should talk about something else let's see here i will talk about vampires because i've recently read a vampire novel by one second uh by amanda ashley this is one a series i think and it's called night's kiss it's totally a housewife's novel you know the romance and the scary and the danger but everything ends well at the end it's definitely a housewife's novel which makes sense cause i got it from my mother and i am also um this is the first season of true blood this has just finished and i honestly think it is probably one of the awesomest things ever and i was really interested in seeing because first i watched true blood and then i read this and in both of them silver can hurt vampires i found that actually very interesting that more than one author thought that um silver can hurt vampires because the true blood series is based on the sookie stackhouse books written by some lady but apparently i'm supposed to read them immediately so i'm probably going to be stealing them from a friend shortly and also everyone has been doing it everyone has been talking about twilight for some way in or another and really it lost i lost all respect for the books because oh hey my dorm mate's coming back hi i'm doing a video blog oh you are yeah cool anyway so anyways my i lost all respect for the author when i found out that twilight was an allegory for waiting until marriage and how women are horrible temptresses because you know in the book bella is totally into edward and edward's telling her to go away and all that crap and also because vampires sparkle now i got into an argument with a classmate in my english class saying that vampires don't sparkle they radiate they radiate light sorry sweetheart they sparkle and honestly the entire thing seems like so horribly mary sue to me that i just i can't read more than i already have being in bookstore picking it up and flipping through some pages um i guess that's a long enough blog then nice meeting you and i'll talk to you guys again,,562
760,okay and my brain basically it was too much and i do get over stimulated to where my i get like tunnel vision or just anxiety that's i don't know anyway um and um i do remember sensations i remember some pressure like a squeeze around my arm i remember my arm being pulled and i remember being um dragged off the bus my legs somehow keeping up with being pulled and then being stood right in front of the individual who i had um yelled at at and i remember this huge gigantic in my perception woman um thirty five feet tall um looking down at me and going you apologize right now i also remember my bladder giving way around that moment um and so i i remember saying something maybe like oh no i'm sorry and uh then um i this is more of a faint memory but i think the same person grabbed me and took me back onto the bus and sat me down but it was right next to this girl that i don't think she stayed sitting next to me go figure um that perhaps there's a little logic perhaps i was having one of those really um trying to like those little adolescent prepubescent uh compulsions to try to show off for a girl one of those idiotic moments which um probably is rather common um but anyway yeah i sat and i rode home that day with my soiled pants and got off the bus went home and then the next day um i was called to the principal's office and he was very calm actually quite polite he asked me if i knew why i was there and i said i did i assessed why i was there and he said so he told me that we're going to go visit the individual that i had told that to now um back then i would've been the younger version of this didn't have these on didn't have any corrective lenses yet um but he told me as i was going and he said he looked down at me and he said you're going to apologize i want you to meet this boy he said now he might behave a little differently but um i want you to um know that he's he said something like i want you to know he's just another boy just like you as you or something like that and i'm like okay and um so i remember him standing there with him and the feeling as though we were holding hands but i don't know if we were i just felt like i anchor onto people when i'm nervous or just even going out to the mall or whatever i will anchor like really focus on people sort of energetically latch onto them as though i'm sort of archly or energy wise holding their hand sort of like holding onto their energy so maybe at that age i was already doing that because that's what my memory feels like and i remember the door opening and the instructor calling to the boy and the boy coming up to the door and looking at me and this boy um didn't look at me with anger or a scowl this boy looked at me with a sort of smile um but of with concern and i looked at the boy and i said um i just said i'm sorry you know and before i could do anything i was being hugged by this other little boy and back then i was i remember like standing stiff kinda rigid but also all i felt was acceptance and uh respect um pretty unconditional not so anyway that was very very touching obviously um it's two o-eight let's see what time i got here and it gave me my first kind of realization of how incorrect these other persons were to tell me that this person was retarded and in no way shape or form of retardo perhaps in ways i'm far more enlightened soul was in a body um so anyway that experience has stuck with me for years it'll probably be with me til i leave this body and probably eternally to some degree um so i feel the energies of others strongly sympathizing though when they do something of their own choice um that probably has consequences that aren't healthy for them or whatever um i,,749

763,what's up guys it's friday and i have to tell you guys about this song that has been stuck in my head let's see how did it go so i put my hands up they're playing my song the butterflies fly away no wait that wasn't it um what was it something like ponyo ponyo ponyo tiny little fish she's a little fish in the deep blue sea yeah that sounds much better right for those of you who haven't heard it it is a new movie from japanese artist hayao miyazaki who is amazing pure pure amazing talent that is hard to come by even in the animation industry when you had people from disney and all that stuff he is just so amazing now if you have heard of it you most likely have heard that noa cyrus who is miley's little sister and frankie jonas the bonus jonas are doing voices in the movie which for some of you i know out there is like amazing oh my god like oh my god it's frankie jonas but for some of you you might not see it because of that because it's another movie from disney that oh it's another cyrus it's another jonas and stuff like that so you might not go and see it here is where i hope you find a turning point first of all they are not the only voices in the movie you have tina faye and liam neeson are also big voices that are in it and that is pure amazing i love the both of them i love liam neeson as an actor he is amazing second of all it's not your average disney movie some of you might recognize the name miyazaki from the movie spirited away which is another one of his works which became really popular in the united states the thing is is they all start in japan because he is a japanese artist and he works in japan all the movies he makes start in japan the only reason they have the disney tag on them is because the disney company is the one who produces them for the united states into an english version they do the english dubbing over them and then distribute them into the u s that's the only reason that they have the disney dub on them so it's not an average disney movie we all have to admit that disney movies are very good especially a lot of the animated ones but if you're not big into all that disney stuff this really isn't a disney movie it is done in japan and it is done by one of the greatest animators and story writers ever in my opinion so that's another reason other movies that have been done by hayao miyazaki which i love include porco rosso nausicaa and the valley of the winds spirited away like i said howl's moving castle and princess mononoke and one of my favorites my neighbor totoro that's another thing is my neighbor totoro along with ponyo are two movies that look like they are made for children which is true hayao miyazaki focuses on movies that are made for children more like more or less he does but the thing is i got into these movies when i was about sixteen i was sixteen when i first saw my first miyazaki movie and i fell in love with it and i did i fell in love with everyone i saw the first one i saw was howl's moving castle which has one of my favorite actors as a voice actor christian bale oh my gosh and it was amazing it is so good and it is just really great and that's one of those ones where it's kind of not really like just a children's story like as a teenager as an adult you can even appreciate it trust me and that's how a lot of his movies are like spirited away was one princess mononoke is another one of those nausicaa and the valley of the winds porco rosso kind of have a deeper sort of story going to them that older minds can appreciate it even my neighbor totoro being a sort of children friendly movie because it has a little the characters are very young which they're um voiced by dakota fanning and her younger sister whose name currently escapes me but even so it's just a it's a heartwarming story that you see in that film that any age can really appreciate it also totoro is this big giant forest spirit who is absolutely adorable but then again i'm a girl and i say adorable way too many times per day it's awful so that's what i'm expecting from ponyo i've seen the trailers it looks like typical miyazaki which is fantastic it looks very child oriented because you have younger main characters which is what he usually has anyways they're usually younger if they're not children they're more teenagers i i would say they look like they're in their teens there is one that is definitely an adult more or less but even so even though it has younger children as the more like the protagonist in this movie it looks like it's gonna have that more serious storyline to it that anyone can appreciate it children and adults alike because you know there are going to be a lot of adults that are taking their children to go see this but i think they won't be disappointed and trust me no matter what age you are you more than likely will not be disappointed miyazaki is such a great story teller a great animator like the animation is always superb and it's just so good and i really really say go see it i'm going to see it as soon as possible that most likely won't be today even though it comes out today but i'm gonna go and see it as soon as i can and you know who else says you should go and see it totoro totoro says you should go see it yeah this is how much i love this movie i have a totoro pillow totoro says you should go see it and so do i so go see it and if you think for one second i'm being paid to do this you've got to be kidding me i am not that popular on youtube are you kidding me i just do these silly little vlogs i am not being paid to do this that is absolutely ridiculous i'm just doing this because i wanted to do a vlog because i haven't done one in days and because you know with ponyo coming out today i wanted to talk about something that i love which is miyazaki and his movies like they're just they're so good i really love them and i'm not kidding when i say that no matter what age you can appreciate them the friend that gave them to me to borrow to watch is my age and he still watches them and he still loves them and they're just they're really good trust me you won't be disappointed and if you are i will apologize i know i know like this certain animation might not fit everyone's styles but if you really do like his stuff you won't be disappointed they're always very well done and i'm so excited that there is finally another miyazaki movie because i was hoping and waiting for it to come out so i'm very excited so you should go see it if you get the chance just just see it okay i'm done i'm done this vlog is done bye,,1301

767,it has also been non scientifically proven that big men likes facial hair you're also welcome la la la la la la la la la la la la hey darling so i'm kinda glad that you apparently like this thing that's going on around here it makes it almost seem worth it the real reason i'm actually doing this guys if you haven't like followed my twitter or my daily booth or anything like that i'm taking part in what they call movember it's pretty much a month long event in which guys grow their mustaches and facial hair to raise money to raise awareness for prostate cancer obviously this is my first time like properly growing out any form of facial hair so it's gonna take a few more practice runs because the mustache isn't really there hence the chin stuff to sort of even out the balance really my face is just a bit awkward anyway like i said i'm raising money so obviously it's based on sponsors i've got a donation page on the movember website link in the sidebar again if you haven't been following me on daily booth i have a proposal for people who donate anyone who donates any form of money to my page can leave a message in which they can leave me a challenge and i said that for every twenty pounds i raise i'll do one of the challenges that has been set for me in a video it's just another little event to get you guys involved because you know what it's for charity and men's health is really important but men you'd better make the most of this for the time being because in about a week there's gonna be an event where i'm going with some of my workmates we're just gonna sorta compare mustaches and have a bit of a shave off so yeah this time next week this will be gone sorry so yesterday was our eighteen month anniversary or mensiversary as people like to continuously correct us so happy anniversary darling i'm glad that the eight ball said that we're going to work out because as you know i totally put my faith in those things i'm just going to bring up a quick point from the comments and last video now as you know she actually got the question as to what we should do for our eighteen month anniversary what neither of us were expecting was a badge of comments of people saying go to scotland or go to australia or meet each other halfway now guys you do realize the anniversary was yesterday and posted her video like four days ago which doesn't really give us that much time to just jump on a plane believe me if we were made of money we would probably be doing these things on a regular basis anyway so if people can't really grasp the fact that we're not just setting off to the ends of the planet for the good of our health it can get a little bit frustrating now i don't want to get all huffy and oversensitive about the subject but you know if we're gonna make this channel work then you guys have to realize that there are a lot of very good reasons why me and aren't together right now anyway subject change you mentioned that it was a normal thing in your childhood for guys to wink at you well i'd scratch my beard because that's really weird well not weird per se it's just something that i didn't grow up with myself it probably doesn't help that britain is like the second most paranoid country in the world there is just no trust between strangers and kids the media is constantly out to scare kids and their parents about strangers anyway the point i'm trying to say is the only stranger that would ever or to wink at kids would've been someone in a santa suit actually now that you think about it oh god i'm just going to wrap this up with some questions before it gets gross one what's the weirdest thing you've ever done for charity two if money wasn't a real issue for you would you just want to instinctively run around the world or would you be a bit more level headed with it and three looking forward to seeing your answers in the comments and i'm looking forward to seeing your new next video see you guys la this is a singer in a recorded song,,766

770,hey this is with one a and when i got home today holy shit my video has a lot of views and comments and all in under one day so i understand that a lot of you still don't get why i made that video well allow me to explain why you shouldn't care about the kanye west and taylor swift incident and no i'm not making a video because i care that kanye west dissed taylor swift on stage i couldn't care less i've got better things to do than worry about celebrities all the time i'm just mad because people care about this incident too much so taylor swift wins the award for best video and after she made her speech kanye west goes up on stage takes the mic and goes hey i'm happy for ya and i let you finish but let me just say that beyonce had one of the best videos of all time of all time ahh who cares is it really that bad that you people have to throw this huge fuss over it you people are over reacting and you know it and just how do we know that you're over reacting well you've been looking busy about this incident in your twitter facebook myspace youtube videos and youtube comments in fact if you posted a stupid comment below you're just proving my point that people care about this incident just a little bit too much i mean just think about it look yourself in the mirror and ask yourself am i a little bit too obsessed with these celebrities the answer for many of you is yes but why there's so much bigger problems in this world to worry about and we're going to worry and get angry over one celebrity dissing another on stage big whoop i mean let's forget about the real problems in this world like poverty starvation crimes wars pollution bad rap music people going homeless people losing their jobs people getting killed and these diseases plaguing your fucked up minds oh no kanye west dissing taylor swift on stage is so much more worse than that what shall we do i'll tell you what to do you need to let this incident go and move on with your pathetic life geez don't you people have anything better to do than follow these celebrities and their lives all the time how about worrying about your own problems in your own personal life first seriously people are just mad because they are popular celebrities it's kanye west and taylor swift if they were two average joe's then nobody would give a rat's ass about this incident and you know it and yes kanye west is a douche bag but let him be a douche bag that is his problem not ours i mean you people aren't helping the situation at all by being mad at kanye west and kissing taylor swift's ass because these two celebrities honestly don't give a fuck they're celebrities they live in their own little world and they don't even know that all the over dramatic bad boys and bad girls even exist so what's the point what's the point of supporting a celebrity so bad if they don't even know who the fuck you are it's not like you people are going to get rewarded for being mad at the situation so just drop it and move on because i'm sure both kanye west and taylor swift will make up and get over this so why don't you people follow the example and do the same grow up and learn how to let things go and don't dwell on the past over some over dramatic bullshit like some fucking five year old crybaby and that goes not just for celebrities but to all you people in people in real life situations as well and lastly it doesn't matter if this bullshit happened at some mtv music vma awards show it doesn't matter that this happened in front of millions of people and some live audience because this incident could have happened anywhere and to anyone not just celebrities and people need to learn how to take criticism and to defend themselves if they're heckled on stage if that was me i'd be like bitch i'm the one with the reward not you in your face so in conclusion people are just being over dramatic crybabies about this incident and they need to let go and move on worry about your own life and worry about the world's real problems and stop worrying about all these celebrities all the time because i can tell you this these celebrities sure don't care about you so have fun crying and being mad over someone who doesn't even know you exist so you know i have a lot of fans and viewers out there and i'm sure a lot of you love and agree with this video but i'm sure there's a lot of you who don't like this video too and once again that's your problem not mine because i'm just speaking the truth and i'm telling it how the fuck it is and a lot of you just can't handle the truth can you oh well but you know what i believe in free speech and i think everyone has the right to express their opinions without being censored so i'll ask what do all of you people think about this incident post your comments in the comments section below and we can have a debate if you still haven't moved on with your life yet anyway this is with one a and that's all i have to say about that peace out,,959
771,hello so it's wednesday night about two in the morning and i have to go to bed but i was sitting around thinking i should probably make a video today because tomorrow i'm going to the mountains all day and then friday i've got a lot to do and this weekend is crazy and i thought i'd just kinda talk to your guys cause i i feel that my updates always have an agenda there's always a purpose there's always a reason but this is just losing weight the hard way weigh in number something seventy four seventy six something my god do you realize that's like i mean hello that's almost like eighty weigh ins it's just ridiculous how long this process gets anyway i just wanted to make a video because i've had a very good week and i wanted to share with you that i'm doing really well i feel like i've really gotten away from the whole idea of weekly weigh ins which is to communicate with the community i i don't respond to a lot of comments on my videos anymore the focus is so much more on below the yellow line and the editing and the creativity it's really a creative outlet for me right now i'm not really sewing i'm really not painting i'm not drawing i'm not doing really anything artistic and below the yellow line for it to be like this huge creative outlet for me um when i edit i just sort of go into this new place and i i have a lot of fun so i realize i've sort of gotten away from what the community was about for me which is about connecting with you all and telling you how i am not giving you grocery not teaching you about a new diet to answering questions or doing a q and a not um you know video um documentary style but like blogging anyway i just you know the whole idea of jess challenges this week was to look in the mirror until you've found something you love about yourself and i don't need to do that because i already really myself in so many ways but sometime tonight during blog tv i realized i said something aloud and i didn't even realize it til i said it aloud but i said something to the affect of most people spend their time at work thinking about how they're missing out on their life on their time with their friends on their time doing what they love but i am one of those people who is blessed to be doing nothing but what they love all the time as a result however i tend to find that when i spend time with my friends i get that feeling that you usually get at work i get that feeling of i'm missing out on work i'm not getting things done and it stresses me out i don't want to be like that as much as i love my job i don't want to be so preoccupied with it that i can't enjoy time with my friends so that was kind of a thing that i thought about and that really has started me on this new path um in the last few hours the last week has really been about me embracing more than my job in my life and so um and i've been thinking about that because that's what jess has for the challenge this week um or week four i don't know it's week five week four i'm always behind or off a week whatever that was the last video i watched of hers and that's what i've been thinking about um so it's probably week five now and i'm all off but anyway i've just been thinking how wonderful a lot of things are going uh how wonderfully a lot of things are finally going for me and that's why i wanted to share i feel like um since i moved to california it was almost like my whole life got put on hold for a couple of months and i've been playing catch up since then i've been incredibly stressed out more than i've ever been in my life i've been going through a lot of emotional changes um jason's helped me realize this is the first time i have been single really single for a long stretch of time since high school i've always been in a relationship a lot of the times i've been in a long term relationship and um i was single for while but i had you know little boyfriends or guys i was seeing the whole time this is the first time that i'm just sort of single and i'm not really meeting people and i don't really care to i just want to be single i like it and it's different and it's scary and it's alo lonely sometimes but it's wonderful you know it really allows me to spend time to come into who i am that's one big shift the other one is that i'm i'm really finally caught up with all my work um i've just been so behind you know on work basically because i've missed work for like two months i kinda did whatever was absolutely necessary during the move you know just to keep the business going but i didn't do anything above and beyond that and then i spent months and months and months playing catch up and now i'm finally you know just doing what needs to be done i don't feel behind i don't feel like i'm terribly um failing at getting my work done um the first full book that i ever published came in the mail today the first draft but it only has like one post it filled with edits to do for the whole book to be done this is my first book i've ever designed um it's not in print obviously but that's it um i'm so proud of it you know i've always said i'm a graphics designer i've always done graphic design but you know there's something really significant about being a publisher and designing a whole book and having it be done there's no words it feels like a year a year in progress and it just it just looks beautiful it's just it's wonderful the index has to be done and there's a lot of work to be done but it just looks really nice i'm incredibly proud of my work on this book i love the back of the cover especially i got the spine width correct anybody who's a designer knows how wonderful it is when your work just turns out beautifully um so work is going great and i've got new projects on the horizon i feel like i'm almost caught up with the youtube messages i've got a few hundred left and i just need to kinda set aside time to do that i think this weekend is going to be the time and um what else is there that's sitting out there oh my blog i'm shitweightloss com i'm always behind but i've let it get really behind lately what i should do is just friggin update the blog when i upload a video but i just never think of it so but i do feel like everything is coming together work is coming together and it's getting back to normal youtube is coming together and it's getting back to normal my life i mean i'm finally eating healthy after like switching to raw foods right when i moved down here in california to then going crazy raw and then completely falling off the deep end eating holy crap bad food for like a month i'm finally coming back in um to some sort of center i'm eating raw the first half of the day and then i'm eating nonprocessed for the second half of the day and i'm exercising again i'm running again monday i went for like a forty five minute walk and tuesday i went for my run today i didn't do anything but tomorrow i'm going walking all day in this little mountain town with lots of shops and stuff and then friday or saturday i'm going rock climbing and i'm going for another run one of those whichever day i'm not going rock climbing i may go for another run um i just i feel like everything's finally coming together and i i was just sitting here realizing you know i i've always wanted this life for i did what i loved and i had a lot of fun doing it and i had a practical budget and way that's another thing my money's finally coming together after going completely haywire with my move i just feel like i've always wanted this life and i suddenly like realized oh my god i have it and now it's a matter of managing it um but i'm there you know greg always said to me i shouldn't work too hard um something like don't burn yourself out and suddenly wake up and realize you're in your thirties and you've never had your twenties um and he's right you know i i work really hard and i'm so ambitious sometimes i forget to just smile and realize how much i have i'm twenty four i work at home doing things i love all day every day i have this amazing community i have amazing friends i have this incredible family and i have an okay money situation i'm incredibly blessed so that's my belated thanksgiving video i am thankful for this life and i'm doing really well although my weight is not going down it will eventually be going down um this morning i weighed in at which would be a two pound loss in the last month um but things are improving and i'm basically almost at goal again and that's what matters so anyway that's all i had to say i'm just really happy and i wanted to give an update for this thursday because i'm really not gonna have um time to make a video tomorrow bye,,1718
772,hey guys totally just trying to make a blog this is awkward for me cause i haven't made a blog in a while hey let me just talk to an imaginary person this camera's not gonna respond it's just gonna get all weird and it's gonna be like you're an idiot hey first totally something exciting that i should share with you guys totally have a job that means i'm making money i'm actually gonna be a tutor at my old middle school i noticed that there is a big difference between when i was in middle school and then the kids that are in middle school now first of all they're freaking tall i feel like a midget i mean i was a midget when i was in middle school i was only like four feet and eight inches i only grew like what three inches since then i don't know i'm standing next to these like five nine kids and i'm like i look like i'm four eleven basically and all these kids are like um you're my tutor i'm like yeah nice to meet you they have a laptop program at this school i don't know if that's or what but they're like i didn't need a laptop til i was in college and i had been working for like two to three years i don't know i don't really think a laptop is that necessary in middle school but i guess times are a changing speaking of laptops i'm taking notes with my laptop now but this dude next to me had his laptop out and was like pounding away at the keys it was like tappety tap tap so loud like hey can you like cut pillows on your fingers like mini cotton balls or something to like mute the sound of your little your fingers so i can distracting so yes along with that i have also just started school a lot of you guys have already been to school for like a few weeks but i just started this week at my uh at my university i go to by the way hopefully soon i will be graduating if i pass all these classes and i'm like good to go since i am back in school that means less time for making these videos and um i do apologize for that but hey i have a life too i mean i appreciate that you guys watch these videos but you should get some sunshine i might not have enough time to make videos so if you guys are really that interested in whatever the heck i have to say i did make a blog d seven one two three blogspot dot com hopefully it won't be too long before my next video but in the meantime just check out the bloggy blog and also i promised mika that i would say hi to her in a video so hello mika thank you for the funnel cake that i've you can make a okay lame,,511
773,hey everyone i'm going to try and make videos of me now and then on english and it's not going to be like beginner beginner lessons but um things that more phrases in english that you might not understand when people use them and for now i have three phrases to share and if you have any questions about english you can just ask me and i'll try my best to answer it the first one is when someone says the alarm went off now when i first heard this it didn't make sense to me because actually the alarm is going is turning on but in english that you just don't say the alarm turned on for some reason you say the alarm went off i don't have an explanation for this but it's just one of those things like we say my nose is running and um your feet smell it's just weird and then you could say the same for a sprinkler went off or the bomb went off the next phrase is um turn off the light versus close the light now whenever you will hear a native english speaker say this they would most probably say close the light it's one of the most common mistakes english speakers make they would say close the light close the tv something like that and but it's actually supposed to be turn off the light if you can remember to say turn off the light instead of close the light it would make you sound a lot more smarter it's not like someone will tell you that you're wrong very few people know that um it's turn off the light not close the light this phrase is usually done with a lot of electronics like close the tv but it is turn off the light the same goes for turn on the light it's not open the light it's turn on the light the last one i have for now is keep me in the loop sometimes when a friend or family member is going somewhere far off um they would they would tell you keep me in the loop which basically means keep me aware let me know keep me keep in touch those kind of things they all mean keep me in the loop so you can say all those things by saying keep me in the loop and i'm guessing this might have developed from the term friend circle that's just my guess i'm not i don't know for now that's all i have so but if you have any specific questions you can ask me through youtube,,443
774,hey guys it's me how are you guys today today's video is just a quick blog what it's like july eighth or something yeah july eighth it's nine thirty in the morning and um amy just done taking me over to the doctors just took in my um my paper work for a disability is that what it was my disability paper work doctor put me out of work for a while saturday i go in this saturday the eleventh i go in for my um i'm not sure if it's going to be my epidural shots or my epidural consultation my neurologist seemed to think i really need this and it's up to the you know the guy actually giving me the shots whether he's going to do them or not so yeah my doctor put me out for a little bit and um and we'll see what happens all right i'll keep you guys posted over here on louis b logging but not really much else to say um you know what i do have one more thing to say amy just went over to uh this is actually funny we went over to what's the name of that place panera bread panera bread aight and of course you guys know i got my coffee right amy goes into panera bread and gets this drink who knew that the straws they give you from panera bread are that big i mean i hope i'm about to twitter this also check the twitter post but that straw is ama i mean that is huge c'mon i would say that's almost a half inch in diameter i mean is it cause they want you to finish the drink that fast it's not cause the drink is that thick but i just thought i'd let you guys know i mean this thing is hilarious amy came out with that big ass straw and i just had to she says you twitter everything else you gotta twitter the size of this damn straw so i am i'm going to go ahead and twitter that off i think it'll be funny aight guys that's pretty much it i just wanna give you guys a head up on what's happening yes i'm out of work for a while um exactly how long i don't know til my doctor gives me back this paper work he has to fill out for my work and um i'll keep you guys posted over here all right i'll definitely let you guys know what happens on saturday when i get my shots and as always lots of love lots of respect alright peace,,445
775,so you guys i'm here and i have not forgotten about my channel and i really want to thank all the new subscribers um that have subscribed to me since uh my last video and um that was about harvey milk and i want to make some updates about the news that iowa has become the third state to legalize gay marriage on friday on april third i think it was april third and by unanimous vote they ruled a ban on gay marriage as unconstitutional and twenty one days after the ruling which is april twenty fourth licenses will be granted to same sex couples to get married so that is amazing because you know um after propate i think there's a lot of movement now that you know this isn't right you know to ban gay marriage or to ban marriage for all like a certain group of people is not constitutional i mean that's like separate but equal but it's not equal you know so that was amazing that iowa out of a lot of states amazingly um is the third state now along with connecticut and massachusetts so other than that um i've been having a lot of fun i went to a quinceanera uh quince anos which is a spanish tradition for women of of the age of fifteen it's kind of like a rite of passage um uh for women to become part of society and uh start dating and all that stuff and it's like a birthday but it's like a sweet sixteen in latin america so that was pretty cool i've never been to one and it was my third cousin's quinceanera yeah and i went to a club yesterday also after that and it was really cool cause it was in the city and i haven't really been to clubs i been more to bars but yeah it's really cool partying it up yes and let's see what else um i'm giving some shout outs to four channels um one of em is um my channel that i um mostly vlog on because i do like a weekly vlog on the five complete strangers and there's also two um let's see there's alex from the uk there is sam from virginia and um there's what else oh the alex from the us uh louisiana and then um then there's me for thursday and then there's chris for friday and that is the five complete strangers and we usually have like a weekly theme um so look forward to that so subscribe to that if you haven't and then there's another channel um manny manny sole manny i just call him manny he steals my money and this is a girl that asked me for help uh back in january like now like a week before like i made my video of coming out and uh she's great she's made two videos and i think she's really under under hype because i know she's a new vlogger and i think she makes great vlogs and she'll probably make more vlogs if you guys subscribe so um i'll post a link in the video right now manny my sole and i hope you guys like her channel and then the other two are the guys from uh the five complete strangers the new guys which is chris chris anything west of lincoln and sam sam is crazy awesome nineteen ninety um so subscribe to those you guys because um you'll be hearing more stuff about me and other people um usually on those vlogs so i hope you guys have a had a great weekend and i'll see you when i make another video and yeah so bye you guys,,627
776,oh well hey everyone i am vlogging from inside of a car in phoenix arizona because i am there on a business trip pretty fun um so this is kind of like an update video all right everyone sigh all right uh we'll continue i am sorry for not making a video in a while i've been super busy i bet the majority of you guys have as well or maybe it's just me i have i really i have a feeling that it's not just me because school started this month so if you're in college or returning to any type of schooling um the first month of september is always crazy especially for me and i'm coaching soccer too which is great if you follow me on twitter you'll know that i am very proud of my team we're undefeated it's under twelves uh i love those kids they watch my youtube videos too so after uh

that's just really really exciting i think you guys will enjoy it um i have a few more videos coming out this month of october we'll you'll see more of me than you did this that last month i don't think i've ever not posted a video ever for like a whole month well i mean a while ago i had but just for the month for the year of uh o nine hmm but i am in phoenix and i've never been here before and it's as i look around like you guys can see what i'm seeing all i can actually see is a wall right now yeah just a wall so that's just not probably the greatest view of phoenix but there is so much cactus everywhere and like people don't have a lawn instead of having a lawn with grass they have or i mean they do have a lawn wait what would it be called a front yard there you go instead of it being with grass it's like dirt that's the weirdest thing ever i mean there's probably going to be comments from people like what your front yard doesn't have dirt and i'm gonna be like no it has grass i'm from california but then there's probably gonna be other comments from people saying i'm from california and i have a dirt front yard i don't know but it's just it's foreign to me okay there you go it's foreign to me so there's cactuses everywhere too and it's the weather is surprisingly nice like i thought it would be just a little bit more i don't know i just when i think of arizona i think of like coyotes and cactus and desert and hot air not having water and i definitely do not think or see think of what i'm seeing there you go i definitely do not think or see i'm sorry i'm all like thrown together right now my thoughts this was just kind of a spur of a moment thing so yeah basically i'm in arizona on a business trip it's been really really cool seeing everything this city is huge like it's massive i thought modesto was a big city boy was i wrong this ceeway city and freeway together ceeway oh another thing i have shirts coming out on district lines pretty exciting um i'm working with designs right now i really hope you guys are gonna like them because they're it's a little bit different probably than my last design and it'll it's for it's good for both um sexes because there were some people that complained a little bit they said that their shirts were too girly and i'm i was trying to think like how can i make a strawberry shirt that isn't girly someone's calling me i won't answer it but uh i don't know how do you make a strawberry manly i think when i think of strawberry i think of i don't know i don't know i'm not gonna i'm not gonna say anything about that but uh future videos i guess just to say there's the question answer one there is a vlog in a you choose i think you guys like that when i give you guys the option of what my next video will be and based off of that video you'll see the result resulting video and then i have a skit with me and my brother that's gonna be really really funny just me and david because uh christian moved to sacramento that's uh burry family news for you guys he's uh left the nest definitely didn't think he would be the first one to leave i thought at least i would be the first one out of the house but he's gone we miss him so um that's about it so yeah i'm starting college i'm in arizona right now um there will be more more videos in october oh and i want to know what are you guys gonna be for

777,bypathway house is for children when they reach six to eighteen so that they learn the skills they need to become a functioning member of society we give these children a chance to be adults so kids who come from russia but russia is part of the ussr and part of communism and part of the soviet union and so these statistics are through the entire area on the first of january two thousand and three there were as many as eight hundred sixty seven thousand and eight hundred orphans in russia alone only ten percent of the orphans are the result of the death of their parents the other ninety percent are social orphans their parents simply abandoned them about fifteen thousand children leave russian orphanages each year once they are eighteen years old of these five thousand are employed six thousand are homeless around three thousand resort to crime and approximately fifteen hundred commit suicide roughly half the girls end up in prostitution there is a video of the chernobyl children's project international has done which would be right here so click on that for more information it shows what they do and it explains how they go about the test of the morality of a society is what it does for its children dietrich bonhoeffer in nineteen ninety one the soviet union ended which meant that a whole bunch of countries had to figure out how to be a government on their own seventeen years later those countries are still struggling there's a lot of things that need to happen for these countries to be as efficient and as good as they can be and there's a lot of these things that will take a lot of time for it to happen and it's not something you can throw money at and it's not something that you can go in and fix in one day there needs to be a full renovation of the government which people are resistant to this charity especially focuses on disabled children because they're the most neglected in former soviet countries often if a child is disabled simply even being blind or deaf they'll be put into a mental institution the country's children are suffering because of it the charity i want to support and mention is called the chernobyl children's project international and it's for countries that were affected by the chernobyl disaster in nineteen eighty six because of chernobyl a lot of radiation was put into that area which caused a lot of birth defects in children and a lot of problems for the people that live there these places do not provide therapy these places provide a meal and a bed many of the children in these institutions are unable to speak because no one has taught them to speak no one talks to these children chernobyl children's project international goes in,,483
778,hi guys i thought i would make this video using this camera today seeing as i can't be bothered to turn on my laptop but i thought i'd get cracking on the whole lee evans video because i know one of my subscribers wanted me to make it so i'm going to talk about lee evans and michael macintyre well you're probably going to find it weird but i've never really heard of lee evans before my subscriber actually mentioned it to me i was like who the hell is he she was like he's a comedian i've seen him on tv and been at my friend's house because she's got a video of him like you know videos and i've been watching him and he's really funny i mean obviously he's a comedian yes i didn't realize he's was that funny i think he's good i think he's a good comedian yes cool he really sweats a lot a big turn off i don't know why he sweats that much my personal favorite comedian michael macintyre who i think is brilliant i think he's amazing i love he's a funny guy i think he's really funny as well as lee evans because they're comedians really i don't know but michael macintyre's my personal favorite i think lee evans is very good comedian as well though is it just me or does anyone else think the same i don't know if you've seen the east indian's theme like when it kind of does a circle bit around london like eot does like a circle bit and then the titles come up have you noticed that they've actually changed the blinking the whole sequence i don't like it it like comes up through the clouds it's really crap it looks so fake some of you might think it looks really good you know it's nice and colorful but i think it is fake well it is fake it just looks so crap do you know those adverts that you get that are like about the whole text love and your partner see how long the relationship lasts they've got this advert where this girl she's like sitting crying outside the church with her wedding dress on going that was so bad sorry she was just and it said she didn't listen she texted her partner's name and her name to eight hundred or whatever and the love match was crapped or something she didn't listen and carried on with her relationship as if everything was normal and fine which she obviously thought it was but then at the end of the relationship on her wedding day he left her i mean as if that's going to happen in real life i hate when they do this grab your money oh my that relationship is not going to last if you want to find out what relationship lasts longer subscribe to us for three euro a week for the rest of your life so we can take all of your money i'm starting college on this monday so yeah i'm really looking forward to the weekend they've got the tent festival in london and diversity are going to be there free as well wow free so i'm going to that i didn't even plan what i was going to do this weekend but i just heard about it a couple of days ago so i thought yes i'm going to that you know that new movie street dance the one who well they're looking for extras so i applied and i'm going to go there on the nineteenth to do whatever be one of the crowd or something i'm looking forward i'm pumped up for that i would like to say thank you to my subscribers for subscribing to me and any time in the near future that you subscribe to me thank you you know i have seventy subscribers at the moment which is a very good success for me because i've never really got that far on youtube which is brilliant yes thank you guys and thank you to the subscriber who wanted the lee evans video i'm sorry i've forgotten your user name yes i'm going to disappear now so thank you for watching and yeah oh,,718

780,this is going to be a spot the ken video so link's down there okay um you know how i promised you a response and i thought i had a good idea but then i started thinking and i realized um well it's not completely out of relevance but it's not as relevant as i thought it would be anyway your video was about celebrities and how we mis imagine them um which i think a lot of people do they just they just oh my gosh they're so hot or they're so sexy and stuff like that but i think that there are people out there that kind of i idolize them or look up to them for some pretty good reasons and and i think that at certain celebrities would be fitting for the term of a role model for example the examples that you gave about acting um it does take certain work to get there i mean you have to be a good actor to start with so you kinda have to practice you gotta join groups and lessons and stuff like that and you got to work on your own skills but then you also gotta get out there like no one's gonna notice you very rarely anyone's going to notice you by chance so you really have to go there you have to go through auditions you gotta put yourself out there and that takes a lot of work and a lot of people aren't really willing to do that you know that whole side of acting and and being in movies and stuff like that somebody brought up and so and so celebrities kind of sometimes get a bad rap about or they just have a scene in one movie plus it might have taken a lot of work to be able to get into that movie and making that movie might have also taken a lot of work so most of all i think kind of don't realize that most of celebrities also don't expect to be that famous i was watching an interview about the harry potter thing and the actors that they said that they did not expect harry potter to be that big of a hit and i myself back when the first movie came out i didn't expect that it to be that much of a hit so granted that was before i became a fan of harry potter i bet it turned out to be really successful and no one really expected that so it's not like they thrusted it upon themselves it was it was pretty much everyone else was pretty much putting it on them they all watched it they all loved it and then it all kind of ties in with i i've always been thinking about how celebrities make so much more money than doctors and stuff like that you you know you mentioned how they don't really contribute anything good whereas doctors and people like that they do well it's i think it's where their money comes from i mean in terms of being a doctor's in canada it comes from the government i think and in america it comes from the actual sick patients whereas celebrities their money is coming from anyone who just watches a movie basically if you go and see that movie you're contributing to their money and you know tying up with what i said before about not asking to be popular if it suddenly does get popular then they make lots of money i mean it's just fair right that they get their fair share of all the profits and i guess the thing with idolizing celebrities is that um they're an example of where you can go the but that's if all what i just said like working hard kind of pays off because i think that generally accepted thing about using the arts as a career is that it's kind of very hard to get into i mean yeah you can do what you like it's not as hard as maybe the sciences but it's really hard to get into and you know there are a lots of actors that have to move far away from home to hollywood and all of that just so they can kinda hopefully break out and many don't so that's kind of that fear i guess so in esteem the celebrities and their success kind of inspires them as well it's just my thinking but don't get the idea that i'm completely disagreeing with you in fact i think i kind of agree with ev everything you said um although it's good to kind of have a role model and it would be pretty great to meet them standing in line just to get a look in real life of someone you idolize maybe not really necessary then again once again i have no right to say what people can or can't do you know i i have a lot of things that i'm sure that a lot of people would disagree with as well but hmm and also some people kind of go way off in terms of idolizing them i was watching the woods show once where some girl said that paris hilton was the perfect role model i don't know where in that child's life that came from but i think something might be wrong there since to summarize it i agree with you on points in your video and i also hope i could have add added something to your thought about celebrities and just one more thing um you were the one that sent me the email regarding the you know right cause i've never done it before i'm still kind of freaked out sorry if i'm bugging you about it bye,,979
781,hey internet it's wednesday december second two thousand and nine and man it's not a good day for the gays no parades today that's because the new york senate smacked down the legalization of gay marriage with a thirty eight to twenty four vote and this vote among many things makes me realize we're just waiting for the old and ignorant to die like strom thurmond god bless his racist motherfucking soul because when a representative in washington is also the same guy that filibustered four segregations you just have to wonder when are you going to die and i know gays are scary to lots of people all fire and brimstone and assless chaps the gays are awesome if not for the gays we wouldn't have the village people the bravo network sodomy and sodomy is so popular with everyone even the catholic church picked it up but with their own little twist on it if you're catholic and offended by that shut up i was raised as catholic from the age of two we're told feel guilty about everything my mother would always quote i would rather you see the good womb of a whore than on the ground where the hell is that and there are three reasons i had to leave the catholic religion one catholicism is anti masturbation two can't masturbate but you're also not allowed to use birth control and three they don't believe dogs go to heaven that's a lie that shit was even in a movie but it's funny that we're actually talking about the catholic church because the catholic church is in the news because of a new peta ad oh my god my two favorite things the new ad involves joanna crupper don't know who she is doesn't matter because joanne is completely naked with a cross in a church surrounded by puppies not even joking i can't show you the full picture not even because i would be flagged so much blood would instantly leave your brain to go elsewhere you would die and i don't need that on my chest not surprisingly the church has a problem with this seeing that peta has a history of exploiting jewish and catholic themes joanna crupper responded that she was shocked that the catholic church was against her ads and she's doing god's work by defending the defenseless animals i'd have to side with peta on this one mainly because i like naked girls and masturbation two things catholicism has shown me that they are not big fans of but back to the gays for some reason they just scare people even in the new video game dragon edge there's a scene where your character can engage another guy if you select the right options you can have gay sex and there's this is weird steamy cut scene and not surprisingly someone's going to have a problem with it not only are those video games making our kids violent they're turning them into homosexuals but the next generation of children will be like motherfucker i said floor print motherfucker i'm a pop your ass seriously there are a ton of websites on the internet that believe there is a conspiracy to turn the children gay what motive i don't know we'll turn everyone gay then they'll realize no one can get married and then that's when they'll legalize gay marriage it's all part of our evil gay plan now where's my body gooder i have to go and do some young sexual boys and turn them gay if we're being completely honest marriage isn't the holiest of holies anymore i mean the only difference between marriage back then and marriage now is the progression of woman's rapes and the invention of the prenup that's why there are so many divorces these days there's no reason to stay in a loveless marriage and that makes me want to go back to tiger woods he's been getting drugged through the mud this week the voice mail audio is released to the internet of tiger woods telling his mistress to change her information because his wife may call and tiger woods apologized to everyone on his website as of today a third woman has come to light to say she had an affair with tiger woods her name don't know let's call her vagina number three i'm wondering when are these woman going to stop coming out how many holes did tiger play but the main question of this video is shouldn't gay people have the rights and the chance to live in a loveless marriage to have and to hold to resent and regret for as long as they shall live i think so but guys that's just my opinion and i know i'll be inviting a lot of heat in with this question but what's your stance on new york slapping down on legalization of gay marriage it's the question of the day guys that's all that matters to me this wednesday my name's and you've just been filled in,,848
782,ah good lighting so background change guess what that means i've moved yeah and my room sounds really echo ey i haven't really talked in it before so yeah but hey um i got home from ansi on friday to find out that they had moved my moving day to saturday instead of today so i've basically packed everything and i pretty much got everything i forgot some things but that's okay they can give it to me my old host parents are just you know like ten fifteen minutes away so but anyway so i have no internet in my room which is a sad fact but i think that it's better because that means that i have to be downstairs when i want to use the computer but they do have wi fi i almost said weefee again that's how they call it weefee new pronunciation beyond moving to my new to host family also um with the we had to do a change of people which meant a change of days so now i'm mondays so if you go to the youtube channel tomorrow at some point after school for me there will be a video up of me yeah and links in the sidebar i'm going to give a shout out now to basically all of my friends who were completely awesome and sent me christmas cards and presents and stuff like seriously i came home from ansi and i had two packages and three letters on my bed that made my day like completely and it was like ray you're amazing i loved my presents i used this all the time and there were like seven other things oh yeah like this friendship bracelet yay but yeah she gave me like eight things as a kind of a hanuka ey things thank you for the card you made me happy i love you and another thing when i got here last night there was already a package i bought some books on amazon and it said that one of the books was going to come on the sixth well it came earlier like on the second or something so maybe that means that my other books won't come on the twenty sixth they'll come like on the twentieth which would be awesome but so now i have inkdeath and i'm so excited this like the series is so good and the movie is coming out this month i found out that it has been translated into french and it's coming out on the twenty eighth so that means that day isn't going to be depressing for me it's going to be awesome i'm not going to explain that depressing part i already started reading it and i really wish that i had the first two books but they have a synopsis of the first two books in the front of the book which is really cool which and it really helped last night my host brothers and their older brother who is normally in paris had a whole bunch of friends over and we played rock band for like two hours and i sang and played bass and it was really fun so i'm happy well i have to go back to unpacking now so i will see you guys on i'll see you guys tomorrow on nerd finderly girls and on wednesday here i think i may go to a once a week with this one just because i don't know maybe we'll see tell me what you think down there bye,,598
783,hi everyone um a lot has happened in the last week so i'm just gonna tell you what all i've done and i have a book to talk about so let's get going okay so over the past week i got a book called dream boy and um i really didn't think it was gonna to be super good i just thought it was something to do it's ah only like two hundred pages a hundred ninety five or something like that and um it took me two days to read and i like i usually don't read books fast and i don't read books at all if i don't like them that much and this was really really good like um the summary of it i would say is like this kid has an abusive relationship with his father and you know he's gay so he finds a guy and all this other stuff happens and then the ending is like really deep and if you can understand the meaning of it it's like it's a big deal i don't know i really liked it so if you've ever read dream boy or seen the movie then just like leave a comment below i've never seen the movie so i i want to see it but i've never seen it i don't know if it's like appropriate or not but anyways yeah so there's my rant on the book also i've realized lately like there's a couple of people that i really want to catch up with but i kind of like am afraid to and i don't know why like there's no reason that i'm afraid to i just like have you ever felt that way where you can talk to someone that you like really enjoy being friends with for so long and then you want to talk to them but you can't or you don't for some reason and it's just really weird because there's this guy and like i've never actually been in a relationship with him of any kind other than just like not even really friends just acquaintances that we talk like we i guess we're friends we talk every now and then and then he moved to a new town which you know he lived on the other side of ohio and now he lives like up north in indiana so it's the same distance away i guess it doesn't even matter cause i probably won't ever see him anyways but i want to know what is going on in his life and all that other all that kind of stuff and it's just weird because like i don't even know him that well but for some reason i still like care about him i i don't even know why it's just like have you ever felt that way where you just care about someone but you don't know why and so i just want to catch up with him and i don't even really know him it's just really weird it's really weird also if you haven't heard adam lambert's like new cd like all of it you need to go check it out because i have never been so obsessed with a cd other than lady gaga because she's just you know she's lady gaga but other than lady gaga i've never liked an album as much as adam lambert's new album and it's just so good like it has so many good songs on it i think my favorite is if i had you or pick you up because those are really up beat and i don't know they're fun to walk too cause i walk to my friends like every day and i don't know they're really fun all right i think i'm done rambling about all these different things for now um i'm going to leave with a question which is um it's do you believe in god or whatever the universe or whatever if you had a choice to die or to go to heaven right now or stay alive and experience the rest of your life what would you do all right thanks for watching guys um follow me on twitter and tumbler and all that stuff so um thanks for watching thanks for subscribing thanks for reading and all that other stuff that you guys do so well and thank you and thank you and thank you to a gay day for letting me fill in for them and getting me so many subscribers um yeah i'm going to head on and work on the homework again night guys bye,,776

787,hello i know that this is really close and i know that my skin is the same color as the white closet door behind me but you know that's just how is it um on a good day so let's just get started band is pretty much taking up all of my time there's really nothing i can do about it and i promise that i will post more videos and get more involved in the once band's over which is going to be november first it's the first day that i won't have any band things to do in the future it's kind of weird thinking about it because band has been such a big part of my life for the past four three years and well this one too but i had my last first competition on saturday and it didn't really go as planned we didn't march because the field was really muddy so it was it was kind of hard to get all sentimental about it but it was nice um it's really weird just thinking about growing up and i'm not necessarily one of the people who want to grow up i don't think that growing up is a good thing necessarily i don't think that my life is going to magically get better once i am grown up besides what does grown up mean anyway um so i finished the hunger and catching fire and i have to say they're the most beautiful most intense books that i have ever read apart from harry potter and they are definitely on my favorites list and right now i'm trying to finish off the catcher in the rye and harry potter's should've died by the lovely mugglenut com and um i'm reading grindle for school and i really want to read a sigmund freud biography so if you know of any super good ones then i would love for you to tell me which one i should read and um i've got to read the iliad and the odyssey i'm not really sure if i like this really zero close up thing but i wasn't really liking the really far away thing either i'm seriously thinking about getting my hair cut really short like i think it would be adorable and i really kind of want to and i don't really have anything else to say but fall break is next week and i'm really not all that excited because it just means that i have to do my college applications because i've been putting them off and um i'm applying to vanderbilt which is in tennessee which is where i live and i'm really nervous about it because i kind of don't think i'll get in i i would love to go there but it would be a lot easier just to go to my local college and just it would be a lot cheaper and i would be around friends but would it be as good of an education no it wouldn't but i'm not really sure if sixty thousand dollars of debt is gonna be worth it all i don't know i'm just thinking anyways i've got a lot of homework to do a lot i've procrastinated on by making like ten versions of this video but i'm going to need to finally just stop making different versions and host this one so i'm going to go and i promise once band's over i will become more involved in youtube and i promise that maybe one day i'll actually smile on a video i know i've been kind of detached and like emotionless at least my expression so that's that and i'll see you guys later okay bye,,625
788,hello there there is a slim chance you are watching this video because you saw it featured on one of my channels or maybe you're subscribed and you saw it in your subscriptions there is a very slim chance that you just stumbled on it or maybe you found it in a related search or in someone's favorites but most likely you are watching this video because it was sent to you as an attachment and a personal message on youtube ahh some of you may be angry about that some of you may even call me a spammer when i put up a video i typically share it out once and then i let it go its own way i don't put pressure on people to watch my videos if you felt pressure to watch this video because i sent it to you in a personal message that was not my intention i put up videos for people to see whenever they have the time to they're not going anywhere because of the number of contacts i have for me to get to all of their videos would be impossible so i can't expect everyone to come see mine they're there for whenever someone wants to come and watch them i didn't gain five thousand subscribers on my main channel by just putting up my videos and letting them go either i do share them out once and i think that is reasonable there are three types of people on youtube overall this is a video sharing website that is what youtube is all about if you don't like receiving videos at all from people then you should get off of youtube go to myspace go to facebook those sites are centered around messages and comments and blogs it's not centered around videos now i don't know about facebook but i know that at myspace you cannot load videos which you can embed and you can send out emails to your friends or your family it's not centered around videos so you won't be getting them all the time i suggest you go over there having my inbox so full all the time with all the stuff it's very hard for me to get my important messages there is a simple solution to that stop using youtube as your personal messaging centre exchange email addresses exchange instant messengers with the people that you would be receiving these important messages from the other thing to do if you just must be on youtube but you don't want videos is put your channel on friend lock go into your accounts settings lock your channels so only friends can message you and then when you get friend invites do not accept them just ignore them some people here think that the label friend on youtube means friend like good buddy pal if you want to make it that you can nobody's gonna stop you but that's not youtube's intention of that label friend when you get a friend invite you get a notification that says friend invitation so and so would like to share videos with you it doesn't say that so and so wants to get to know you personally and establish a one on one emotional connection with you when you get one of these friend invites you just might think to yourself well so and so is sending this invitation just because they want to send me videos well yeah once again this is youtube it's a video sharing site the whole idea is to send a friend invite to exchange videos with to see if you like the videos that they're sending you to see if they like the videos you send them and maybe if you like them that much you might subscribe to each other here's a little clue if you don't like their videos you don't have to subscribe but if you have friend lock on your channel and you don't want them sending videos to you any more it's a secret all you do is remove them as a friend and then they can't send you videos any more it's as simple as that and that's all i have to say and you know that if uh this video was sent to you and i hope that it didn't bother you too much but in case it did well you know what to do about it thanks for your time and keep trying out your videos it's related to your videos but it is not spam now just because doing this is not spam doesn't mean that it can't be abused every single day my inbox is flooded with hundreds of personal messages with videos attached to them some people send me the same video three times a day some people will send me a few different videos every single day some people will send me one video every single day but i don't say anything to them i accept it because i'm a video watcher and a video maker and i'm serious about the videos i make i want people to watch my videos so by me allowing people to send their videos to me i expect that they can't get mad at me for sending them videos i don't send many personal messages you might get one from me i don't know once every other week maybe if that maybe a whole month will go by and you won't even get anything from me with the exception of this time because you know i just couldn't resist but to send this message out through a personal message so i get my inbox flooded with all this stuff i try to send one message to people and i get a lot of heat from it and that's crap i put up with all this i try to send out one video i got people calling me a spammer doing this reasonably is not spam and don't let anybody ever tell you other,,1009
789,posing as a palestinian born muslim suffering from israeli oppression interestingly enough he was later exposed as a christian born in cairo so what he was up to i still don't know here comes the full circle edward saed has a very good friend he wrote a forward for a book that dis he described as very much necessary reading the book is titled fugitive days and the author you'll never guess yup if you recognize this thug it is william ayers who has pretty much faded from spotlight but i think we should bring him back because obama continually plays him down but as we see there is much more to ayers than most people even realize in fact i'd probably pose more questions than answers but the way i see it is on some very powerful people with some very dangerous motives have groomed and launched obama into the spotlight he has deep muslim ties and the fact that he accomplished nothing other than run for president should make every american stop the capital and other buildings he's never apologized but thi this is an example of what i'm talking about uh this is a guy who lives in my neighborhood who's a professor of english in chicago uh who i know and who i have not uh received some official endorsement from he's not somebody who i exchange ideas from on a regular basis oh i'm such a shit i figured this was a shut case someone was smearing obama and that was it but not so fast the sutton family actually contacted by newsnet com surprisingly said that kevin wardally is not a spokesman for the family but actually a player in harlem politics and someone challenging sutton for the position they denied any links to wardally who did not even get sutton's age right apparently sutton was actually not so what about obama's campaign officially denying obama knowing al mansour well get this al mansour himself admitted he knew obama further saying in an interview with newsnet com again involved in any way in celebrity sweepstakes i wish him well anything i can do if he'll let me know i'll let him know what i think i can do or can't but i don't collect autographs i wish him the best and hope he can win the election nineteen eighties al mansour gave lectures at including in places like columbia university i suspect they met there but who is al mansour and why should we even care jeremiah wright move over you ain't got nothin on this guy check out the impressive resume well known in the black community as a lawyer an orthodox muslim a black nationalist he mentored huey newton founder of the black panther party an educator politically outspoken hater of israel all the jews who support obama pay attention and an author with works that include i quote the lost books of africa rediscovered where he illustrates how united states was planning to perform genocide against black americans the destruction of western civilization as seen through islam christianity and judaism and americans beware the zionist plot against saudi arabia it still doesn't make any sense what is al mansour one of the most connected well known black muslims in the world have to do with obama well actually he does jack cashill from worldnetdaily wrote an article by the name of candidates interesting title i must admit and al mansour has a friend or used to have a friend named edward said an author and apparently somewhat of a terrorist sympathizer due to his very left like leanings well al mansour and said have connections to the publishing world in columbia obama attended some of his lectures where they became friends apparently because there is a photograph floating around of a arab american dinner,,643

793,that is a subtle thing let me do it somewhere where it's more visible maybe um here there i like it um yeah it was on sale so i got it uh yeah they have such crazy eye shadow colors i bought like such boring ones because i'm bored they have such nice ones like that amazing blue just check out the website i think you can also order no you can definitely also order otherwise there'd be not much point in me showing you all this um they have really really cool stuff you have to see it it's pretty amazing then i got this which i love i love i love this eyebrow marker um it's kind of like a eyebrow pencil but it's a marker it's got like a kind of felt tip here and so it's the only thing i've ever found which is works at all got perfect that there's always one swipe you know and i didn't smudge or anything it's i got kind of semi permanent tattooey one i love it i love it love it love it just use it to like fill in places in my eyebrows okay i don't have any spaces so there's nothing to fill in but it's so good and they have it in three different colors one is for um brunettes and black haired people one's for red heads and one's for blondes sorry i'm having problems breathing today so i love this i was gonna buy this another thing i love love love is this um ultra tech mascara this is so so this is one of the best mascaras i've ever had i bought it last year cause it was it was on sale it wasn't on sale this year but i still bought it it's got a like tiny little brush with those tiny little bristles which usually isn't a good sign but this mascara is really really really great i can only recommend it it's like good for everyday it's not got too much volume i don't really like that whole volume thing but it's very very lengthening and um clump and all and i think it's superb it's really the best mascara i've ever tried okay maybe not the best but the best for the price at which comes so then i got this um eye shadow palette whatever set kind of thing called back to black cause i realized i never do smoky eyes and this might just be the perfect thing to do smoky eyes with well i thought it was but let me explain in a second so here it's got like different shades of grey and white and black and i thought it would be really really perfect but um you'll see i do some swatches that i don't know the colors aren't that great on you know um they are too sparkly so it's not really smoky eyes it's just ridiculous i i do like the black it's very very good black you can see very highly pigmented um but like uh i can't really get it on here you know this grey for example is so shiny it's like sober i i i don't enjoy that no um that was the darker grey and now the lighter grey it's exactly like the darker grey there's like no difference whatsoever actually now that i look at it like that there maybe but it's very hard to see in fact this is the lighter one and this one actually looks lighter this one's more silver this one's more grey i don't know it's it's not you know um then the white is i guess okay but it's like uh too cold for you know there are cold whites and there are warm whites and this is kind of a very icy almost within like slightly blue tinge i don't know if you can see that but yeah so i'm not that happy with the palette even though it's you know it's pretty cool it's got like a mirror and everything and then but uh i don't know if i'm really gonna find much use for that cause those colors also really don't suit me so yeah i'm gonna have to look for someone doing the look with greys and blacks and whites otherwise i'll have no idea how to do it anyway right then i got this uh lipstick i don't i'm not sure which one it is color twenty two they only have like two types of lipstick anyways so i don't know and it's this uh very very dark red i shall do a swatch my hand is getting kind of full here i love it actually it's the perfect pin up girl bettie page red you know you'd think this was a really common color but in most drug stores i've not been able to find that this like nice kind of berry very wine dark red but like you could find it but it's usually too dark and too like harsh and this one's still quite playful and cute and also the lip liner i bought one matching that i'm not really into the darker and also it's been impossible to find a color like that now i want it to be darker and then i'll blend them i can actually you know what in the next video i'll um put the lipstick on so you can see the look yeah and so i've done it like that i think it's beautiful very betty page pin up girl kind of thing so yeah it's a great company with everything i got and uh i really really really love their stuff i think it's you know it's almost there it's not quite i don t think up to the standards of like mac and stuff and other professional companies even though it is a professional make up company um but i think it's still very very good so check out the website i'll put it in the side and thank you for watching actually scratch that um i forgot to say something one part that i do not recommend by them is this soft color blush um i have one from last year i didn't buy one this year and it is terrible it's so highly pigmented i'm just like poking with the brush and i know it's a product brush so i got and look at this i got this uh clown way too much you know it's like impossible to apply it without looking ridiculous so i think um with blush also um the high quality is not only shown in the pigmentation but also in how natural it looks and how like um how easy it is to apply,,1138
